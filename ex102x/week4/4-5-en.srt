00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,760
In the previous video we calculated the highest
possible profit by changing the amount of sugar

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,940
in our lemonade.
But for that we needed to use a lot of space

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,030
on the Excel sheet.
Also we needed to do lots of thinking.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,700
What is the formula? How do I add the data
table? Add conditional formatting.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,020
And I promised you that we would let Excel
do the thinking instead of us.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,530
So in this video I will make it even easier
for you to find the highest profit using a

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:34,150
tool in Excel called the Solver.
The Solver is already built into Excel.

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,790
However, before you can use it,
you first have to enable it.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,440
This is how it looks like.
We go to the options of Excel.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,200
Then we go to Add-Ins and we click
'Excel Add-ins' and there it is: the Solver.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,560
We just have to tick it.
And then it appears right there.

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,690
You don't have to reboot Excel, you can
immediately use it because it is now enabled.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,080
So what does the Solver do?
The Solver is a little bit like Goal Seek,

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,260
but is more powerful. Because, we are not
just saying we are looking for a goal.

15
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,260
We can maximize or minimize values and
take multiple cells into account.

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's see how that looks like.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,579
We are going to delete these cells.
We don't need the Data Table anymore, because

18
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:21,039
we will directly get the right value.
We click Solver, there we go.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,200
Now we can say what is the cell
that we want to analyse: that cell.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,620
We want to set it to maximum
by changing the value of sugar.

21
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:36,380
So we see it is quite similar to Goal Seek.
In the background, let me move that, you already

22
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:41,309
got the value. You see that? BAM! Immediately
it happened there, right in front of our eyes.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,060
We got the maximum value 120... and something.
It is very precise.

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,360
We didn't need a Data Table.
We didn't need conditional formatting.

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,740
We didn't need extra room on the Excel sheet.

26
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,720
We just got the value immediately.
Isn't that nice?

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,940
And the Solver is even better than that!
Because we can do more powerful things.

28
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,060
Let's have a look at what we can do as well.
We can also change the water and the lemons.

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,780
We don't need to restrict ourselves to just
one value of sugar as with the Goal Seek.

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,520
Here we can actually use multiple cells.
So we can say: change water and change lemons too.

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,280
We again get a solution. However, we now
have 0 for water and 0 for lemons.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,740
Let's not do that.

33
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:33,020
Let's revert back to the old values. If the
Solver solves something that you don't want...

34
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,160
you can always use this option to go back to
whatever you had before you ran the Solver.

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,680
You don't have to be afraid that the Solver
will mess with your entire spreadsheet

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,940
because you can always check this
option and it will reset everything.

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,980
So this is not what we want.

38
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,160
It's zero lemons and zero water.
What we wanted is something more realistic.

39
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,620
Solver can help us with that
because we can add constraints,

40
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,900
which are rules that the Solver has to listen to.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,240
For example we could say: The lemons have
to be at least 3 lemons and the water

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:12,100
has to be at least three times the amount of sugar,
otherwise it will be very strange lemonade.

43
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:17,849
So if we set these rules the Solver will find
the solution within those rules.

44
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:24,749
So what we get now, as you can see, is unfortunately
exactly 3 times the amount of sugar...

45
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:28,920
and exactly 3 lemons.
That is of course not that strange, because

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,120
the rule we have for the expected sales only
depends on the sugar.

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,100
So whatever we do with water
and lemons is not of effect.

48
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,390
So for the homework this week
you are going to change that.

49
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,650
We will give you a new formula for expected
sales, taking water and lemons into account.

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,890
And then it is your goal to use the Solver
to find the perfect lemonade.

51
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,050
Good luck!
