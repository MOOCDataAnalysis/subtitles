Hi! Welcome to week 4 of EX102x!
We have the first half of the course past us.

2
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:11,859
So if you have made it so far: Congratulations!
Awesome!

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,140
So I thought, halfway the course
it is time for a new example.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,780
So this week I am running a coffee shop.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,900
Again, we have export data from a register.
So we have dates, times, products and sales prices

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,420
and we are selling awesome products like
juices, coffees and waffles.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,420
All the things you need to be a productive citizen.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,820
Last week we talked about making predictions.

9
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,280
Looking at your data and distinguishing trend lines.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,580
So if you have watched the videos and done
the exercises you have seen something like this:

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,400
A trend that is happening within the company.

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,150
But of course, a company is not a static thing.
We actually have influence on the company.

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:59,560
We can turn the knobs of our business.
We can start a promotion, or buy new products

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,090
or discontinue a whole line of products.
We can change things.

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,620
This week's topic is:
What happens if we change things?

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,240
What if analysis.
What will be the influence on our business

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,120
if we make certain changes?
