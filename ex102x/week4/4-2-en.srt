00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,080
'What happens if?'
That is the topic of this week's videos.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,880
So we are looking at the data of the coffee
shop and we are wondering: How are we doing?

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,500
How is our sales going? So, of course
the first thing you are going to do:

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,120
You look at your data and you...

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,859
Insert a PivotTable, of course!

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:24,470
And what is important here is, this time we
untick the 'Add data to the Data Model' checkbox.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,090
I will explain to you later why we do that.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,220
So we put in all the sales and we put in all the dates.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,260
Let's make the sales look like a currency.

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,640
It looks a bit prettier and
it is easier to see what is going on.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,660
However, we now have all the sales per day,
and it is quite hard to see what is happening.

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,070
So what you can do in a
PivotTable is group the data.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,060
In months, or in this case we
want to have it in quarters.

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,760
We get a nice little overview of the quarters:
Quarter one, quarter two, quarter three.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,040
This is why we have to untick the checkbox
for adding data to the data model.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,540
For reasons I also don't understand
this grouping feature only works...

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,060
if your data is not in the data model.
So we have to deal with that.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,280
What we are going to do nowâ€¦

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,000
First let's rename this worksheet, because
obviously 'Sheet2' is not a good name.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,820
Let's call this 'Sales Target', because
that is what we are going to calculate.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,120
We have a goal for the sales
we want to have per quarter.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,520
We have set ourselves the goal to on average
make $40,000. That is our goal.

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,820
So how are we doing towards this goal?

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,600
Are we getting close? In this quarter, Qtr4,
we have not made any money yet...

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,020
so let's set it at zero for now.
Now we can calculate the current average.

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,660
We take the average of the three
quarters that we already have...

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,280
combined with the fourth quarter that is
currently still zero.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,300
So you can see, we are not there yet,
with not any sales in the fourth quarter.

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,520
We are only at 28 thousand.

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,360
So the question is: What do we have to make
in that fourth quarter in order to hit our average?

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,860
What do we have to do?
What do we have to make up for to get it?

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,880
What we could do, of course, is
calculate this with a formula.

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,440
We can say: well, I know
I need 40 thousand every quarter

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,980
so 4 times 40,000 is what I
have to make for the entire year.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,460
Then I can deduct what I have already made by
summing the three quarters and then we get the result.

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,520
46 thousand and something is what we have to make.

37
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,040
But this is a lot of work.

38
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,760
I have to think about all the formulas I need.
I can let Excel do the thinking for me,

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,080
because Excel is a little bit better at
doing calculations than I am.

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,040
We can use a function for that called 'Goal Seek'
where we will have Excel find a goal for us.

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,140
This is how it looks like.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,040
So we are going to delete these formulas,
we don't need them anymore

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,380
because we will do it smarter and more efficient.

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,180
We go to the Data tab and
we click 'What-If Analysis' -> 'Goal Seek...'

45
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,880
And then, Excel will let us pick a cell we want to set.

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,840
We want to have an average of 40,000 and
we will achieve that by changing that cell.

47
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:18,800
We are going to change the Qtr4
sales and there it goes... Tadaa!

48
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,910
The same value: 46 thousand.
In this case we did not need any formulas.

49
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,969
We just have Excel calculate what we need
to obtain a certain value.

50
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,249
We want to have Excel do
the thinking for us.
