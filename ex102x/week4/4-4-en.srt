00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,380
This is where we left it off
in the previous video.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:10,020
What is the highest profit we can make by
changing the value of sugar in our recipe?

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,600
To calculate that automatically we are going
to use something called a Data Table.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,619
And it is quite hard to get it right, so pay
attention, bear with me, while I construct...

5
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:22,219
the whole Data Table.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,780
What we first need to do is decide on what
options we are going to thrive for sugar.

7
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:35,200
So let's say we start with 50 and we do
increments of 50, so we get 50, 100, 150, etc.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,320
What we do now next to the
sugar and it has to be there...

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,560
is we take the value that we
want to analyse.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,760
So we directly point with
an equal sign to the value.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,900
And that, of course, has the whole trace of
precedence all the way back to the value of sugar.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,540
So if we change sugar, then that value will also change.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,320
Now we select this whole range with the options
and the formula that we are pointing at.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,820
And now we get two options: row or column.

15
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,740
Our options are in a column,
so we have to say column.

16
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,059
And there we put the value that corresponds
with the value in our column.

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Tatatata... Now we get the value
based on that formula for everything

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,940
that is in the column. It is a bit hard to see,
but if we add conditional formatting...

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,120
a nice color scale, we see HA!
The maximum is there in that green area.

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:39,360
Now if we want to zoom in a little bit, what
we could do of course is change the input values.

21
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,380
If we change the sugar there,
immediately the Data Table will update.

22
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,260
So let's have a look at how that looks like.

23
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,480
We change this into 100 and we
change our increments from 50 to 10...

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,800
we drag the formula down, and now we see:
there at 120 is where the maximum is.

25
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,200
So that is really nice.
Without doing any extra formulas we have...

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,860
an overview of what the value of this formula is
we are pointing at for all of the different input values.

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,840
That is the power of What-If Analysis!
