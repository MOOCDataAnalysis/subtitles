00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,940
In the previous video I showed you
how to let Excel do the thinking for you

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:11,240
and in this video I will show you another example
how Excel can help you do the heavy lifting.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,920
So if you have downloaded the spreadsheet,
you have seen that there is a worksheet

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,940
where we have all the recipes.
All the things we sell in our little shop

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,420
and how to make them.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:30,980
For example: For 4 servings of lemonade we need
200 mg of sugar and 750 ml of water and 6 lemons.

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,420
Of course, we can play with this a little bit.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,390
We can adapt our recipes and see what the
influence of that is on our business.

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,370
So here I have an Experimental Recipes worksheet
where I've written down the recipes...

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,670
but I've changed it a little bit so that the ingredients
are values that we can calculate with.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,889
I also have a cost price for each of the items.
If I want to know what the cost price of one...

12
00:00:53,899 --> 00:01:00,359
glass of lemonade is, I have to pairwise multiply
the values and sum everything together.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,980
Luckily Excel has a build-in function
for that called SUMPRODUCT.

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,620
So I just select the first range and the second range
and Excel will multiply and sum automatically.

15
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,720
Of course, this is still the price for 4 glasses of
lemonade, so I have to divide by the number of servings.

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,640
We can see: one glass of lemonade costs $1.05.

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,260
What is the sales price?
You have seen this a number of times.

18
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,160
We can type it, it's $2.50, but of course
we want to have a dynamic dashboard...

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,700
so we will use a VLOOKUP.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,420
We go to the Sales Prices worksheet
and we select the second column.

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,880
And of course you know this from the previous MOOC:

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,980
We have to select FALSE here to make sure we
get the right value even if we do some sorting.

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:55,560
Now we can calculate the profit - this is just
economy 101 - by deducting the total cost price...

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,800
from the sales price.

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,680
And then we know the profit we make
on one glass of lemonade is $1.45.

26
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,920
Now here is where the experimentation starts:

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,940
What happens if we change the
amount of sugar in our recipe?

28
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,280
We know this. We have, actually in the homework
of last week, derived a prediction for that:

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,360
150 plus 0.6 times the grams of sugar in
our lemonade is how much sales we make.

30
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,940
So now we can estimate the profit by
multiplying the number of expected lemonades

31
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,220
with the profit we make per lemonade.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,940
If we leave our recipe like this (200), then
this is the profit that we make.

33
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,730
But if we change it a little bit:
let's say we make it 150.

34
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,080
You see, it changes.

35
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:55,280
We sell less items, but we make more money
because we save money on buying sugar.

36
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,340
So you see, we sell less, but we make more.

37
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,189
And if we change it into 180 we sell a bit
more, but we make a bit less.

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,040
So the question now of course is: What is
the highest profit that is possible?

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,640
What is the best amount of sugar in our lemonade,
not tastewise, but profitwise?

40
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,420
That is what we are going to figure out
in the next video.
