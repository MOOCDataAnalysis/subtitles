1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,740
So, we are finished with the tables,
so let's have a look at graphs.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,020
If there are a few things that you have to
remember about this course, then...

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,460
this would be one of them:

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,980
If you are creating a graph you have the responsibility...

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:22,080
to maintain a visual correspondence
to the quantity you display.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:30,520
Now, let's have a look at this graph and try
to think what is wrong with it

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,000
because there is a lot wrong with it.
I will give you some time for that.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,699
Now, what we see in this graph is
"Sales are Skyrocketing!"

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,640
There is a very steep increase of the sales.

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,860
But if we actually look at the data and
if we represent it in the rightful way

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,280
then this would be the message:
"Sales is flat"

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,340
What kind of tricks did they do in this chart?
I think the first one is very obvious.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Their y-axis does not start with 0 and
also if you look at the scale of it...

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,740
it's really a very small interval
of data that they are showing.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,700
What they also did is:
They decreased the aspect ratio.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:31,460
They made it a square graph and because they did that
they overstated the amount of increase you see.

17
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,420
Also, they used a green line and
in Western culture green is good.

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,460
So that is another thing that supports
the message that sales are skyrocketing.

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,080
And also the black color is helping with that.

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,900
So we have to be aware that if we create a graph,
we very easily can manipulate the reader

21
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:02,289
what they are going to see, and we have some
kind of responsibility to stay close to the truth.

22
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,380
So that is important when you create your graphs.

23
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,440
Another one that I would like you to remember is:
Stay away from 3D!

24
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,620
If you would ask me... Because this is very nice, and
it is very easy to create in Excel with a few mouse clicks

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,680
you have this very nice graph,
but if I am going to ask you now:

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,620
"What is the value in the first quarter
of the south region?"

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,360
then I would be very interested in your answer,
because it is very difficult. We cannot see it.

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,540
It is hidden behind the other ones.

29
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,780
So, 3D, if you present it on a 2-dimensional area,
that is never a good idea.

30
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,640
Now, what is wrong with this: completely nothing.

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,180
You should always use 2-dimensional graphs.

32
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,480
Now, this is a little bit boring, because if you go
into Excel and if you look at all the chart types...

33
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,220
there are many of them.

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,440
But what I am going to tell you is that actually,
there are only three basic graphs that you can use

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,720
to express almost any message about
the data you want to show.

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:25,620
The first one is a scatter plot. That is very very useful
if you want to highlight a relation between two variables.

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,160
The other one is the good old plain line chart.

38
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,560
Very useful if you want to show a trend or a time series.

39
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,200
And the third one is the bar or the column chart.

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,080
If it is horizontal, we call it a bar chart,
if it is vertical we call it a column chart.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,960
They are very useful if you want to compare
different categories with each other.

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,440
So these are the basic graph types.

43
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,560
One was missing, and that is the pie chart.

44
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,409
We did some research on it and it is one of
the most frequently used charts.

45
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:12,720
But I would really advise... I would almost
say urge you, not to use the pie chart anymore.

46
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,800
And I will try to explain why.

47
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:23,040
First of all, humans have a difficulty in
estimating how big an area is.

48
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:32,920
So, my question would be, if you look at circle 1 and
circle 2, how much larger is the area of circle 2?

49
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,600
So what is the problem with pie charts?
Here we see a very classic example of a pie chart.

50
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,080
We have different companies with different values.

51
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,760
If I ask you what is the part of company C?

52
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,740
You probably would immediately say 25%.

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,420
So, what is wrong with pie charts?
It is very clear, isn't it?

54
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,300
Well, if I would rephrase the question a little bit, and say:

55
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,580
Could you tell me what are the
values for companies E and F?

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,360
And now it is getting really complicated,
because it is very difficult for us to say,

57
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,580
well that is maybe 1% or 2% or 6%, actually
I don't know, I have no clue.

58
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,480
But, ask Excel to the rescue.
We can add some data labels.

59
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,340
So, now at least we can see that
company F is 1% and company E is 7%

60
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,840
but what I actually have to do in my brains is I have to
look at the legend, I have to look at the color,

61
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,560
I have to go back to the chart, look at the color,
look up the value, and then I see company F is 1%.

62
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
That is not really easy for your reader.

63
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,660
And it is important that it is easy for your reader,
because you want to get your message through

64
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,880
so it should be as easy as possible for your reader.

65
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,480
Now, we could help that:
Remove the legend and add some more labels.

66
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,280
But, really, if we do all this, then
why not just put it in a table?

67
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,360
And, if you really want to use a graph, and
I would agree on that, I would even advise that.

68
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,440
What is wrong with a simple bar chart?

69
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,400
I can rank very nicely the companies, also visually.
So I see immediately what is the largest company.

70
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,330
I see what is the smallest company.

71
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:31,880
For humans it is very difficult to make an estimate of
an area, but to compare lengths between two lines,

72
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,200
that is something we are very good at.
So that is really helpful.

73
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,520
And then there is still one argument that people
throw at me if I say "don't use the pie chart":

74
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:48,280
They say "yes, but the pie chart will help me
to see everything related to the whole."

75
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, that is still possible, because we could change
this chart and put in the relative part next to the label

76
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,240
and make a sum at the bottom to see
that everything ties up to 100%.

77
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,120
Now I have a part to a whole information
in my graph without using a pie chart

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,280
and making it very easy for the reader to read
this information and to get the message.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,280
So that are some remarks about
the structure of the charts.

80
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,040
But as we did with the tables, we will also focus on
some of the best practices in charts in the next video.
