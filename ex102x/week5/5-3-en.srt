1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,580
So in the last video we stood still by the
distinction between tables and graphs.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,740
Now in this session we are going to focus
on the design of tables.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,620
Actually on the structural design of tables.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,920
There are only three types of tables.
Let's have a look at them.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,260
The first one is the most simply one.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,260
It is called a unidirectional table, actually
meaning it has only one dimension.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,940
We have a sales person and we have revenue
and they are just displayed into separate columns.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,900
Now we can make that a little bit more complicated

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,460
because it could be that we have
more than one category.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,180
So, next to Sales person we have also Country.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,700
Then we can organise the different
categories in some kind of hierarchy.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,540
Now we see the sales person and within the
sales person we see the different countries and

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,160
we see the revenue he or she created there.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,620
That is still a unidirectional table.
It is still one dimension.

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:13,040
It is all organised in rows, but now we have
some kind of hierarchy of the different categories.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,300
But we could also create some kind of
a two dimensional table.

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,520
It is called a cross table or
bidirectional table.

18
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,800
We have the same categories. We still have
Sales person and we have Countries...

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,900
but now we have put the countries in the columns and
we get a more compact display of our dataset.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,460
So that are the three types of tables: We
have unidirectional with one category,

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,280
we have unidirectional with several categories
but organised somehow in a hierarchy, and

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,640
we have a bidirectional table where we have
categories across the rows and across the columns.

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,700
So what about derived values?
Let's have a look at this table.

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,240
What we see is the different products
and the units we have sold.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,400
And we see the revenue that was
generated by these products

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,360
and we also have some kind of forecast.

27
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,840
And then we have two columns that are actually
calculations of earlier columns.

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,640
So we have a percentage of total, and in this case
it is the percentage of total of the actual revenue,

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,500
and we have as a percentage of forecast,
which is actually the actual revenue...

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,560
as a percentage of the forecast.

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,940
Now you already can see that the way I have
to explain it, this is not really clear.

32
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,400
So we should not do this.
If you have derived values, if you have values

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,980
that are calculated based on other columns,
we should move these calculations...

34
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,980
as close to the other columns as possible.

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,740
And now you see we have moved the percentage
of total and put it next to the actual revenue.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,540
Now it is very clear that the percentage of total
is a percentage of the actual revenue.

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,100
The same is true for the forecast.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,560
So, that about derived values.
Now, what if you want to compare?

39
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,400
Here we see again the same data,
but now we want to have a difference between...

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,080
the forecast versus the revenue and
forecast versus the planned revenue.

41
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:22,460
If that is the case, it is important to have the columns
that we have to compare, that we locate them...

42
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,220
as close as possible to the column to compare with.

43
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,620
Whitespace. Now if you open your Excel spreadsheet,

44
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,800
and if you create your data, Excel will by
definition give you a default row height.

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,900
And that determines the amount
of whitespace you see.

46
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,860
Maybe you are wondering
'Why is whitespace important?'.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,640
Whitespace helps us to determine
what is a row and what is the next row

48
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,760
and to distinct two rows from each other.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,640
The more whitespace I give, the easier it is.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,260
But of course there is a balance.

51
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,480
Here you see different values for the whitespace
and it is up to you to determine...

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,600
what you think is best readable.
My preference is either the 50 or the 100 percent.

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,520
It is important that you know that you have a choice
yourself that you can help the reader by...

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,100
defining the amount of whitespace
how he or she can interpret the table.

55
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,960
We can do that for rows, but of course
we can also do that for the columns.

56
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,960
That actually goes back to what
we said in the very first session:

57
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,960
It is all about the message.

58
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
What do I want to tell?
What do I want to give to people?

59
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,120
How do I want them to read my table?
Should they read it by column: column by column?

60
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,860
Then this would be a very good choice.
Or would it be better if they read it row by row?

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,560
What I could do then is decrease the amount
of whitespace between the columns

62
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,300
and increase the whitespace between the rows.

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,280
Then, people are automatically going to read
the table row by row and not column by column.

64
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,080
So, in this video we saw a little bit about
how to design the structure of a table.

65
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,740
In the next session we are going to look at
some best practices that will help us...

66
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,800
to create really awesome tables.
