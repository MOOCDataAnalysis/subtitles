Hello everyone! Welcome to week 5 of EX102x.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,940
The topic of this week is the
design of graphs and tables.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,140
So let me show you how to make a graph in Excel.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,140
We have some data here: Sales people
and the revenue they are making.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,580
I am simply selecting all the data.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,800
I will click Insert, Recommended Chart
and then I got a wonderful bar chart.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,320
I just click OK and it will appear in Excel.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,860
BAS: Hey Felienne.
FELIENNE: Hey Bas!

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,720
BAS: What are you doing?

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,000
FELIENNE: I am making a chart.
BAS: What is that guy 'Total' doing there?

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,740
What do you want to tell?

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,560
FELIENNE: Uh eh... I don't know.
I just clicked insert recommended chart and...

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,480
I figured Excel would know what to do.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,760
BAS: Okay, shouldn't we maybe think a little bit
before we start creating the chart?

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,200
FELIENNE: Yeah, you might be right. Could
you help us out with this week's topic?

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,680
BAS: I would love to explain it.
FELIENNE: Great!
