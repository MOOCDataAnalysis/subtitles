00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,930
In our last session we have looked at the
structural design of tables.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:10,180
But, we also prepared some little tips for
you how you can even improve your tables further.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,540
So, let's have a look at that.
The first thing is about the grid.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,320
Unfortunately we still see a lot of tables
that are displayed in the upper left corner

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,260
where a full grid is used.
As we said in our introduction:

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,380
We have to think about the data-ink ratio.
Are all these lines telling us something about

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,750
the data that is in the table?
That is actually not the case.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,840
So we should try to get rid of all the lines
and keep only the lines that we really need.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:52,940
That is the table in the bottom right corner.
What we see there is that we need a line...

10
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,380
to show you show you which three countries
belong together, we need a second line

11
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,800
to make a distinction between the header of the table
and the body of the table and we need a line

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,500
to make a distinction between the body of
the table and the footer of the table.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,320
And that is all we need.
For the rest we can organize it with whitespace.

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,700
So, try to imagine that the pixels are very
expensive and try to minimize them.

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,920
Now, if you look in your Excel interface,
you can format tables.

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:34,420
A lot of popular formats use alternating colors
in different rows, so the first row is white,

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,380
the second row is green, the third row is
white, the fourth green and so further.

18
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,820
Actually, I think that is not a really good use of fill.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,420
If you want to use fill, again, it all ties
back to your message, to your goal.

20
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,000
What do you want to communicate?
If I want somebody to pay attention to a single

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,119
cell in the table, then that would be a very
good use case to fill the cell, and that is

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,960
what I did in the first table. We made it red,
so it is very clear, people have to look there.

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,260
But it could also be that I want them to focus...

24
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,570
on a certain sales person in a certain region.
In this case, Mr Hanson in the United States.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,760
So I used a very light fill to highlight the
row and the column and it will guide the eyes

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,319
of the reader of the table to these data.
So, I can use fill to influence how readers

27
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,859
are going to read my table and to help them
to understand the point I want to make.

28
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,560
Now some basic rules about alignment.

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,760
It is not really difficult. If it is text, you align it left.
If it are numbers, you align it right.

30
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,000
And then the only trouble we have with dates.
You see it at the bottom of the screen: actually,

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,520
the alignment of the date, that is not really
a problem, but the format of the date itself.

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:08,020
My advice would be to try to get your date in a format
that has the same length for every possible date.

33
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,780
Would you use a date like 'January 1, 2014',

34
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,300
then consider it text and do a left align.
And if it is all the same length...

35
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,760
then you can either use left, center or right.
You see that the wide columns in the bottom table

36
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,600
those are the situations you don't want to end up with.

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
So that about alignment.

38
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,220
Also, you have to think about the levels of precision.

39
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:50,160
So in the first column we see three times '2' at the
bottom three rows. But actually, it is 2.4, 2.1, 2.0.

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,700
If that is important for my message, because
that is the question: Does my reader need...

41
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,660
to understand that there is a difference
between these three values?

42
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,360
Then I need to at least show one decimal.

43
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:08,120
Making it two decimals in this case would not
be necessary, because from the 2.4, 2.1, 2.0...

44
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,300
the reader can already see that there is a difference.

45
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,600
Only if the precise value would be really necessary,
then I could increase the number of decimals.

46
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,680
And then we have the number format.
We see now the revenue column

47
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,360
and it is a bit difficult to read.
That is because there are no thousand separators.

48
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,820
So I always would advise
to include a thousand separator.

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,540
On the right side, you see something different.
I did not tell you when I introduced myself

50
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,320
but actually I am a financial guy.
Financial people really don't like negative values.

51
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,200
So we try to hide that a little bit by putting
a negative value between parentheses.

52
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,120
But the troubleâ€¦ What you can see now, if
you look at the second number in the table

53
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,770
and compare it to the third, is that the numbers
are not aligned, because of the parentheses.

54
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,680
And that is something you need to fix.
You can do that, and what you would like to see is this.

55
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,600
The numbers are all aligned, but there is some space
around the number so put the parenthesis there.

56
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,460
I would really like to show you
in Excel how you can do that.

57
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,370
So that in an exercise you
can try that for yourself.

58
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,259
So here we are.
We have the same data.

59
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,780
I am going to select the data...

60
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,800
and I go to the cell properties to the number format.

61
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,180
Here I can see the number format and the trick.

62
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,039
Here we see the wrong number formatting.
We see that the alignment is not correct.

63
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,700
We want to change that. So if we go to the cell
properties, we go to the custom number format...

64
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,260
then you see here the number format
and there is a semicolon in-between.

65
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,840
Left to the semicolon is the positive value.

66
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,231
Right to the semicolon is the format of the
negative value.

67
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,530
And here we can see that negative values
are within parentheses.

68
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:35,860
The trick we have to do is that we have to instruct Excel
to reserve a little bit of space for these parentheses.

69
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,400
We can do that by entering an underscore...

70
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,180
and then the character that Excel
should reserve space for.

71
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,400
And if you do it like this... If it displays
a positive value it will ignore this, but

72
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,980
it will make a little bit more space, and
that is what we can see if we click on it.

73
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,740
So now we see that...

74
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,760
You can see that next to the 8 there is little room
to make sure that everything is well aligned.

75
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,420
So that is about the number format.

76
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,000
With that we end the best practices for table design.

77
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,740
Also we finish the chapter about tables.

78
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,280
In the next session we are going to look at graphs.
