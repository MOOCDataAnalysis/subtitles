1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,210
So last time we looked at the design of the
graphs from a structural point of view.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,640
This time we are going to look at the best practices.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,880
What we needed to remind from the last time was:

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,500
Try to stay as close as possible to the truth.
Do not try to manipulate your readers.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,160
Never use a 3D graph and try to avoid pie charts.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,840
In this session we are going to focus on some
of the best practices to create really beautiful graphs.

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,480
One of the basic chart types was
the bar or the column graph.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,300
Now, when should you use a bar
and when should you use a column?

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,600
Actually I don't have a really strong opinion about it,
but there are some basic rules.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,700
One of the most important aspects, or
determining aspects, are your labels.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,320
If you look at the two top graphs, then you see
for example United States does not fit on one line

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,880
if you create it in a column graph.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:07,440
So if you have long labels it makes sense to create
a bar graph or bar chart instead of a column chart.

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,300
And there is another one, if you look at the
bottom left you see you have a time series there.

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,960
I could also create a bar chart for it, you
can see it at the right, but that is very strange.

16
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,720
As soon as you put a time dimension in the vertical axis
of a graph it gets very difficult to understand.

17
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,000
Time for us goes from left to right.
So if you have a time series and...

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,060
you want to use a bar or a column chart,
you should really choose the column chart.

19
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,780
Now, with tables we saw the importance of
whitespace, and for graphs it is exactly the same.

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,920
Also there you have a choice.

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
You have to be aware that your
spreadsheet software, in this case Excel...

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,640
will default it for you,
and the default is not always right.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,820
Here you see some of the different
values that are possible.

24
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,530
I like that the whitespace is about 100 or 50 percent.

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,920
And I would just like to show you in Excel how you can
influence the whitespace between the different columns.

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,840
So here we are.

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,300
I just select all the data.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
I learnt that from Felienne.

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,180
We go to Insert, Column chart.

30
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,380
There it is.

31
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,700
I really do not like the amount of
whitespace that I see over here.

32
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,819
For me this is too much and I want to change
that, so I select one of the columns.

33
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,259
It does not matter which one.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,540
I right click.

35
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,360
I format the data series.

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,660
And then, over here

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,900
I can adjust the gap width.

38
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,720
I will put it, and I like to type it in, to 50%.

39
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,580
For me, I think this is better readable.

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Important is that you understand you have
a choice there and you should think about it...

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,680
what it will do with your message.

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Now, this is a very old one.

43
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,700
At some point in time we had matrix printers.
They could not print colors...

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,620
and we created graphs and we used
different fill patterns to make sure...

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
to distinct the different categories we had in our chart.

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,620
They are still around and because they are around,
people are still using them, but please don't do that.

47
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,960
On the other hand, be aware that even today,
not everybody has the ability to print in color.

48
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,820
So, if it is printed and you are not quite sure
that they can color print it, use greyscales.

49
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:20,560
If you know that your graph is either color printed
or on a screen, then this is really the best option.

50
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Use colors with a good contrast to distinct
between the different categories in your data series.

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,840
Now what about legends?

52
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,660
This is the standard by Excel.
It puts it to the right.

53
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,760
Let's think a little bit back to the data-ink ratio.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,340
So what I see here is it is to the right.
It is taking space...

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,860
and I would actually like to use
that space for my graph...

56
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,440
and there is a frame around it that really
does not add something to the graph.

57
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,620
So what we could do very easily is
put the legend to the bottom.

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,300
Now I have more space for my graph,
I do not have the useless border...

59
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,560
and I am really using my pixels in a good way.

60
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Now another one, remember the very first chart
that we saw in the previous video.

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,720
It was the 'Sales are Skyrocketing' graph.

62
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,460
One of the things the creator of the graph did
was playing with the aspect ratio.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,040
You can overstate and understate
the increase the data is actually making.

64
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,560
I like my graphs to have an aspect ratio from 1 to 1.5.

65
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:43,200
I think 1 to 2 is UNDERstated (correction!) and
the 1 to 1 or even the 3 to 2 that is really OVERstated.

66
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,260
Be aware that you influence your reader with the
aspect ratio and that you really can change it...

67
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,730
if you create a graph in Excel.

68
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,460
Now, another problem is that sometimes we
have a lot of data, and you want to show it.

69
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,520
Now, our short-term memory can handle 7 things...

70
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,220
but actually putting 7 variables in one
graph is really not easy to understand.

71
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,520
I would say 5 is the max, and even that...
If I could somehow present the data...

72
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,980
without putting it all in one graph, I really would do that.

73
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,180
But, as a rule of thumb, 5 is the max.
If it is more than 5, you have to find another solution.

74
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,960
Now what could that other solution be?

75
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,920
Here we have a table.
We now know this is a unidirectional table...

76
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,330
with a hierarchical presentation of two categories,
namely the Distribution Channel and the Region.

77
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,320
There is quite some information going on here.
We have a Distribution Channel: Direct Sales,

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,500
Distributor Sales, Reseller Sales.
I have the 4 regions, I have the bookings,

79
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,020
the orders that I got in, and I have the billings.
I want to represent this somehow in a graph.

80
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,880
But that is too much data to put in a single graph.

81
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,280
What you could do: Instead of creating one
graph, create several smaller graphs.

82
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,300
I have an example for that over here.

83
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:17,040
So what we see here is, we organized it horizontally
and we organized it by Distribution Channel.

84
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,980
To the left I have Direct Sales,
to the right I have Reseller Sales...

85
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,400
and what you see, for example if you
look at the labels on the y-axis:

86
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:28,679
I only have created them for the most left chart.

87
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,840
The other charts don't need a label because
they can borrow the label from the first chart.

88
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:40,560
So you are looking at three different charts, but
on the other hand, they are also one complete chart.

89
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,979
The same for the legend.

90
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,379
I only have the legend in there once, because
it is the same for all the three graphs.

91
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,680
Still I have a lot of choices how I am going
to present the data, and there is no rule

92
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,419
for it what is the best way, because it is
depending on what I want to tell.

93
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,199
If I want to focus on Distribution Channel,
this would be a very good option.

94
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,740
But maybe, I want to focus on region, and
then I would shuffle the data a little bit...

95
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,660
and put in the region in the columns.

96
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,620
Or, I could do something completely different,

97
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,460
because the trouble here is, if I want to, for
example, compare the bookings of West...

98
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,660
to the bookings of South, then I can do it, but
it is difficult to see the difference in length.

99
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,820
It would be easier if it would be presented vertically.

100
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,500
So that would be another choice.

101
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,420
And that brings us to the end of some of the
best practices to create very nice looking graphs.

102
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,640
In this session you got a lot of theory about how to
design your tables and how to design your graphs.

103
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,940
In the session of next week we are going to bring
this all together and create our own dashboard.

104
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,920
Hope to see you back next week.
