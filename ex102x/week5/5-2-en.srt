00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,459
Hello everybody. Before we dive into this topic,
let me introduce myself a little bit.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,020
My name is Bas Jansen. I work as a PhD
student at Delft University of Technology.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,720
I am a member of the Spreadsheet Lab,
working together with Felienne.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,780
You see my email address and my Twitter handle on
the slide, so if you want to contact me, that is possible.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,840
Then I would like to start with the subject.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,980
We live today in an era of big data.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,270
Yesterday I read a very nice quote: "Millions
of dollars yearly are spent in the collection...

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:39,110
...of data, with the fond expectation that the
data will automatically cause the correction...

9
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:44,089
...of the condition studied. Though accurate
data and real facts are valuable, when it...

10
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:50,649
...comes to getting results the manner of presentation
is ordinarily more important than the facts themselves."

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,559
You may say 'Okay, that's a nice quote'.

12
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,499
But what really surprised me
is the date of this quote!

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,900
This quote is more than 100 years old.
So, actually, there is nothing new here.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,720
Second, what I think is very important, and
I had to learn that the hard way, is...

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,659
that when it comes to getting results the manner
of presentation is ordinarily more important

16
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:21,539
than the facts themselves.
So it is not about the numbers only.

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,039
It is also about how you present them.
And although we learn in school how to write...

18
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:34,170
a report or how to give a presentation, little
attention is spent on how to display and visualise...

19
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,760
quantitative information.
And that is the topic of today.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,750
So let's have a look.

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,540
One of the founding fathers, and Felienne
mentioned it also last week, is Edward Tufte.

22
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,360
He wrote a very nice book that I would really recommend
to read: 'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'.

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:00,040
And he coined a term, he coined a definition.
That definition is the data-ink ratio.

24
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:08,760
Data-ink ratio means that it is the amount
of data-ink you use as a proportion to the total

25
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,570
ink that is used to print the graphic.
Maybe what would be a better representation

26
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,640
of that is thinking like this: It is one minus
the proportion of graphic that can be erased

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,600
without loss of data information.

28
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,340
Let me illustrate that with a little example.

29
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:33,760
So we have a table here, and you see that
there is a very heavy grid around every cell.

30
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,860
The question is: does that grid tell us anything
about the data that is in the table?

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,180
And that is not the case, so we should reduce that.

32
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:52,300
We can do that by making the grid less heavy.
But what would be even better is to remove the grid.

33
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,660
Every line that we see right now has a function.

34
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:04,080
We see the line under the countries. That is
telling us that the three countries belong together.

35
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,460
And below we see a line below the Sales person.

36
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,040
That is to divide the table in a header and a body.

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,880
And at the bottom, we have a Grand Total and
also there we use a line to divide it.

38
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:25,520
So now the lines are not just some paint on
the screen, but it is really useful information

39
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,840
that is helping us to interpret the table.
So data-ink ratio means: Do more with less.

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,040
Use as less pixels as possible to get your
message to the audience.

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,900
So, what are we doing when we are visualising data?

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,480
What we saw Felienne do in the introduction
was that immediately she went from the data

43
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,560
to formatting the message.
She selected the data and she clicked on create graph.

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,780
But actually she is skipping a few steps there.

45
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,110
Those are the steps we are focussing on today.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,920
First, if you have data and if you
plan to say something about the data

47
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,500
then actually you have a goal,
otherwise you would not do that.

48
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,560
So, be sure for yourself what your goal is.

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,160
What do you want to tell about this data?
And then the second question is:

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,600
Who is your audience?
What is your audience like?

51
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,820
Are they very detailed people that want to
have the sixth digit after the decimal point?

52
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,520
Or are they more general people who say 
'Well, just show me a graph'?

53
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,260
And, if I know what my goal is,
what should be my message then?

54
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,880
What do you want to tell?
If that is clear for me, then I can start...

55
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,440
thinking about how I am going to format the message.

56
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,660
So, when you are visualising data and when
you are visualising quantitative information...

57
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,300
actually we only have two tools that we can use.

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,380
That is a table or a graph.

59
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,380
Now, before I am going to explain
the difference for you

60
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,940
we have a nice little quiz for you
to think a little bit about...

61
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,920
when you should use a table
and when you should use a graph.

62
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,060
So tables, you normally use them
to look up individual values.

63
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,800
Think about a phone directory, that is a very
big table and you use it to look up data.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
Tables are excellent for that.

65
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Another thing that is very handy in a table is

66
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,310
you can really check individual values
and compare them to each other.

67
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,400
Tables are also very good if
you need very precise values.

68
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,220
Now, imagine you have some kind of dataset, where
you have kilograms and where you have speed.

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,440
Try to imagine to plot that in one graph.

70
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,910
That is very difficult, because you have two
different units of measures that you cannot

71
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:14,780
plot on the same axis, so you need more than
one axis, and it is very difficult to interpret the graph.

72
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,720
So, then a table is much easier
to understand.

73
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,940
And finally, if you have in your dataset data
on a summarised level, for example subtotals,

74
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,360
and you have the details, that is almost impossible
to represent in a graph, but it is very easy

75
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,290
to do it in a table.
So that is when you use a table.

76
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,080
Now when would you use graphs? You use graphs
if the message you want to bring to your audience...

77
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,380
is about the shape of the data that you have.

78
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,500
Is there some kind of pattern that you want to show
or some kind of trend that you want to highlight?

79
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,220
That is really where a graph is very useful.

80
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,720
And the other option is when you want to reveal
a relationship between two datasets.

81
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,620
Are variables correlated or not?
You can very well use a graph for that.
