00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,080
We are exploring our data today, and we are
doing that around the question:

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,660
'How many green socks did Tokyo sell on Wednesdays?'

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,820
We were already getting close in the previous video.
We had color, we had category.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,540
One thing that is missing is the date: the Wednesdays.
So, what we could do is add a slicer.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,000
Here you see me do it through the ribbon.
That is an alternative way to get a slicer in.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:32,180
Add a slicer for date... But those are a lot of dates.
Suppose we have to get our calendar out

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,620
and see which one of those are Wednesdays.

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,460
That seems like a lot of work.
That is not something we want.

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,399
An important takeaway from this course is:
If you see that something is going to take

10
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,459
a lot of work, if it is like an hour of manual labor,
probably there is a smarter way to do it.

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,840
And that holds in this situation as well.

12
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:55,679
So let me show you a smarter way to select the Wednesdays.

13
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:00,289
This is not what we want. Let's delete this
horrible slicer with all the dates

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,440
and look at alternative.
So what we could do is add a formula, for weekdays.

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,340
Excel has a formula WEEKDAY, where you can

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,860
just input a date, and you get the number of
weekdays from 1 on Sunday and on.

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,760
So, this works.
However, now we are mixing formulas and data,

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,580
and that is never a good idea.
And also this weekday column is not in the

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,090
data model yet, so we would have to make a
new Pivot table including weekday.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,760
This is no good, I don't like it.
There has to be a better way to add a field.

21
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,749
Well let's change that sheet name as well
because obviously 'Sheet4' is not a good name.

22
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,960
So what is a better way to do it?
Let's use our superpowers!

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,000
If you have done the previous MOOC, you know
about Power Pivot, which is like a Pivot table

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,780
but a lot more powerful.
Like a Pivot table with superpowers.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,180
If you have never seen Power Pivot before,
again we will post a few links under this video.

26
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,030
Watch them first please, because otherwise
it can be a bit too much to be introduced

27
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,920
to Power Pivot in a speedy way.
So if you know it, feel free to move on with me

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,260
and have a look at how we can solve our
date problem using Power Pivot.

29
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,659
We can click 'Manage' here in the ribbon and
now we get the data model.

30
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,040
So what you see here is all our data.
Here we can add a weekday column as well

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,840
in exactly the same way as we did in Excel:
we just add a formula: =WEEKDAY.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,360
We can use any formula out of Excel here,
and there you have it.

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,660
And you don't have to even drag down.
Power Pivot automatically updates it for all the records

34
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,200
Ã¡nd automatically adds it to your Pivot table.

35
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:46,089
So it is right there. You can add a slicer for it
and now we can count: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,

36
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:52,709
Wednesday, click. Tadaa!
All the green socks in Tokyo with just three clicks.

37
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,620
And not only have we now calculated the green

38
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,980
socks in Tokyo on Wednesdays, but we have
made an interface that allows us to analyze

39
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,680
any color, any category, on any day of the week.

40
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,959
So we have prepared our self for exploratory
analysis of our data.

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,360
See you next week!
