In the previous video I've shown you Pivot charts
and in this video we are going

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,300
to dive in a little bit deeper. What you can do,
for example, let me show you here

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,240
is add as many fields as you want
to the legend.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,920
For instance if we add 'Category' we get a nice color
for every combination of product and category.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,060
But suppose we are only interested in shoes.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,429
We can filter this using the normal filter.
"Oh no, we are not only interested in shoes...

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,200
we want socks as well."
You see we can filter, but it is a little bit cumbersome.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,240
Every time selecting the category
and then filter.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,640
We can make that a lot easier by using slicers,
a really nice technique that supports exploratory

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,340
data analysis.
If you have a look with me here:

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,300
Let's right-click a category and pick
'Add as slicer', and you get a nice little control panel

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,520
for the category and you can just select
whatever category you are interested in: bras, pants, ...

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,400
Using the CTRL (or SHIFT) key you can even
select multiple categories.

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,090
As easy as that.
So let's add another slicer for color, because

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,530
ultimately of course we want to have green
socks, so we add color as well.

16
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,460
And there: one click for green, one click for
socks, and we have an overview in our slicers.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,360
So without any formulas or complicated analysis
you can just select the fields you are interested in,

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,680
add a slicer and then mix and match and
see what interesting patterns emerge.
