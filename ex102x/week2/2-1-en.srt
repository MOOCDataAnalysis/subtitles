Hi! Welcome to week 2 of EX102x. Last week
we talked all about importing data.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,340
How to get your data from a csv file in to your Excel.
And that means this week we can talk about

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,280
answering questions, questions like this:
How many green socks did Tokyo sell on Wednesdays?

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:25,330
That is what we are going to try to figure
out this week. And that is a typical example

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,410
of business needs that we talked about. There
is a need from the business to know something,

6
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,109
and that needs to be answered by a real-time
report. Because obviously your boss wants

7
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:40,409
to know how many socks they sold in Tokyo
right now, not in five weeks. This needs to

8
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:46,719
be a real time report. So it is our job to go
through all the steps: importing the data,

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,939
wrangling it, and then analyzing it, and that
it what this week's material is about.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,760
Not just analyzing it, but doing exploratory analysis.
Because not all the questions your boss can

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,480
ask will look like this. Sometimes she will
ask questions like "Are we doing well?"

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,340
A very generic question that can be somewhat
hard to answer. Ehh.. are we doing well?

13
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,020
It could be in terms of turnover, or growth,
specific products that are doing well.

14
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,340
So these type of generic questions, to be prepared
to answer them, we want to have

15
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,460
a dashboard setup that will help us to answer them.

16
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,340
So if we want to answer such a question, we want

17
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,470
to do data exploration, and that is what we
are going to do this week!
