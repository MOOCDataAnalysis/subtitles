1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,020
So we are going to explore our data, and that
will help us to answer very specific questions

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,660
like the one about green socks in Tokyo, but
also generic questions like "Are we doing well?",

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,059
"How is our company going?"
And what we are going to use for that is a technique

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,800
based on Pivot tables. So if you have never
seen a Pivot table before, if you have not done

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,440
the previous MOOC or learned about Pivot
tables in a different way, stop watching this video!

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,520
We will post a few links underneath
this video to help you get acquainted

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,540
with the idea of Pivot tables. You really need that for the
remainder of this week's material, because

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:43,300
we are going to use a technique that is heavily
based on Pivot tables, which is called Pivot charts.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,220
And I will show you how they work.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,160
Here we have our data from last week, and

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,020
we can easily select it using CTRL+SHIFT+DOWN, and what we are going to do is insert a Pivot table and chart

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,160
Don't forget to add your model to the data model, because we will need that later

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,240
What we get now is a Pivot table AND a chart, and the two of them are connected together

14
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,380
So if you change something in the
Pivot table, the chart will automatically update

15
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,870
As you can see here: we get the sales
for all our three branches.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,260
Immediately we get an overview of the different turnovers for the different stores.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,940
And we can add brands here too and we do that by adding a legend.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,460
You get nice little colored bars that show

19
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,360
what brand we are selling in what store.
So you can see that Adidas is not really popular

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,880
in Rotterdam, because the bar is really small.
And in this way you can easily analyze your data.

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,140
You just add a Pivot chart, select the
fields that you are interested in, and with

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,680
a few clicks, no formulas or difficult analysis needed
you get an overview of how your company is doing.

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,940
Isn't that cool!
