Welcome back to EX102X.
Last week we talked about data exploration.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,640
Looking at what happens inside your data.
But the only thing we have done last week

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,310
is look back, look into the past of what
happened to our data.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,630
But of course using data,
we can also look into the future.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,400
We can determine using data: Where are we
going? Are we on the right track, or should

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,040
we maybe switch and start doing something else?

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,020
And that is the topic of this week.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,240
If you have done the exercises
this is what you ended up with last week.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,979
And, if you have not done them, then it is

10
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,330
really best that you stop watching this video
right now and first do the exercise, because

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,510
it's a lot more fun if you work on data you
prepared yourself.

12
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,799
So using the data that you have made in the
exercise of last week, we together are going

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,560
to detect trends in the data.
