00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,840
So this week we are detecting trends,
and the first technique you already know

2
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:10,649
because it is conditional formatting that we used
in the previous MOOC as well.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,900
What we did in the previous MOOC like I am
doing here is just use one threshold and visualize

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,130
what is above and below it, and you automatically
get the average here.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,340
It shows something, but it is not exactly
what we want.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,930
We can do more powerful things
by using color scales.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,740
So as you see here, you get a visualization
that is wide, very much, a lot of different colors.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,120
However, not all the visualizations are the same.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,820
For example the second one, visualized,

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,380
this is high numbers with red
and low numbers with green.

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,400
So don't just randomly pick one. Make sure that
the colors match what you are trying to tell.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,020
So this gives us an indication of the data.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,000
You see that high values are very green, however
it is a bit unfair to compare pants and socks

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,780
because socks are just a lot cheaper.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,380
So it would be more fair if we have one color scale
per product category, and we can do that.

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,890
Let's remove this and add a new coloring.
So we pick one range and then we add the scales

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,220
and that means it is scaled over only that range.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,079
So a high value in pants might get a different
color than a high value in socks if they are

19
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,520
the same value.
So this already gives us an idea of the data.

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,819
Isn't that nice? We start to see some trends.
For example bras were selling quite well early

21
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:36,549
in the season, and now doing a little bit less,
whereas socks had a slow start, but

22
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:42,489
now seem to be greener and greener.
With a few clicks, a few conditional formatting rules

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,780
we already get some idea about our data.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,380
But there are lots of other things we can
do with conditional formatting as well.

25
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:54,869
One thing that I really like is the Top 10 feature,
where you just get a visualization

26
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,069
of what is doing best. Especially if you
have lots of products, that is nice.

27
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,039
You can also add data bars, which is like
a mini-chart within your data.

28
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:08,269
And finally there are icon sets, where you
can click circles or stop signs

29
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:12,140
instead of coloring the cell.
One thing I want to point your attention to

30
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,340
is these arrows, they are called 'directional'.
You might think that they are visualizing a trend.

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,000
But they are not!
They are exactly equal to the circles.

32
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:25,129
They just give an up arrow for a high value
and a down arrow for a low value.

33
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:29,980
They are not actually representing a trend.
So be aware, if we are trend plotting

34
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,100
don't accidently use the arrows, unless you are
actually calculating a difference.
