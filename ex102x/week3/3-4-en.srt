00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,440
This week we have been detecting trends.
In the previous videos...

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,820
we have done that in two different ways:
First using conditional formatting

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,140
and secondly with spark lines.
But those techniques are a little bit like sketching.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,940
You don't really know what's there yet.

5
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:19,029
We are just trying our hand,
trying to understand what's in the data.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,520
But I think you are ready for the real deal now:
Make a real graph.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,120
So let's go back to our spreadsheet
and make a graph together.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,780
So let's get rid of the spark lines.
We don't need them anymore.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,600
And if we look at the data, one of the results we got
from the analysis, exploring it, ...

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,520
is that these first and last week,
they are not real weeks.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,780
They only have little amount of data.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,140
This is why it is better to remove them,
to filter them out at least...

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,280
to get a cleaner view of the trend in the data.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,720
So we remove the conditional formatting as well

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,340
and we are now ready to add a real graph.
Here we go.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,570
We are going to add a PivotChart, because
as you have seen last week

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:04,019
this is a nice interactive way and we can still
play with our data if we want to.

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,360
Let's make it a bit bigger, there we go.
So if we look at 'Pants', we thought the trend

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,960
was that there was a little top in the middle,
but overall it was flat.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,060
What Excel can do is add a trend line
on the graph and then you see

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,100
Excel is helping us understand our data, because
even though there are some fluctuations

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,940
the trend line seems to be flat.

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,800
So if we do the same for bras:
we add a trend line there as well

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,880
unfortunately we see that
there the trend is going down.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,880
We are selling fewer and fewer bras every week,
even though it seems a bit similar to pants.

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,560
There are some ups and downs.
We can make it even more interesting, because

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,420
what we can also do is add a prediction.
Now, the trend line continues even after our data.

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,360
So we get a prediction for where our trend is going.

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,460
We can use this trend line to
make actual real predictions

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,280
about how many bras we will sell
two weeks from now.

31
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,980
What you can do there, let me show you:

32
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,520
If you select a trend line and right click...
[Format Trendline...]

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,220
you can change it. So you can make the
prediction a little bit longer, let's say 5 weeks.

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,780
And what you can also do, that makes it really interesting, is add the equation on the chart.

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,240
So here Excel explains to you:

36
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,860
If you put in the week number, how much money
will we make on bras in a few weeks.

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,800
And in the exercises you are going to
make predictions on the data...

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,540
using this generated equation.

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,120
Good luck!
