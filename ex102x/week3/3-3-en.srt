This week is all about detecting trends.
In the previous video we used conditional formatting,

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,380
added colors to our data to get
a sense of what products are doing best.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,080
However there is a risk in using colors.
Some people are color blind and they might

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,260
be very bad at distinguishing red from green.
And also some people might think it is visually

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:29,100
not very attractive to have lots of colors
on a spreadsheet, and there is some sense in that.

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,280
So in this video I am going to show you an alternative way of quickly exploring your data.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,260
And this way is called spark lines and it
was designed by a man called Edward Tufte.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,280
He is like the godfather of data visualization.
Below the video we will put a few links to

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,720
a few of his books that are really really great.

10
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,890
If you want to learn more about how to visualize
your data in a concise but beautiful way,

11
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,140
I can really recommend these books.
So one of the things he invented is called

12
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:03,790
sparklines and it is now embedded into Excel.
So we want to make a spark line for this and

13
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,480
normally I would place it on the bottom, there.
But because I don't have room on my screen

14
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,380
for this time I am going to put the spark
lines next to the data.

15
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:17,030
So I am just going to copy the header.
And what I do then is I am going to go to

16
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,029
'Insert' and 'Insert a line'.
It is not called 'spark line' but just 'line',

17
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:25,981
a little bit misleading.
So we select the data that we want and there:

18
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,890
BAM! We get a nice tiny little graphic showing
the flow of the data, the trend of the data.

19
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,670
And you see the top right there, on the top
of the graph is the same as the green cells

20
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,090
that we had before.

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,020
We can even select 'High point' (in the ribbon) and
then you get a marker.

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,079
Like a formula we can drag these spark lines

23
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,939
and then we automatically get it for 'pants'
and 'shoes' and 'socks' and for the total.

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,779
You see for socks there we have the top right
there as we have the top in the data.

25
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:58,019
So, it is a really nice way to look at your data.

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,200
And like with conditional formatting, there
are lots of different options that you can use.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,660
For example you can change them into
a column bar instead of a trend, which is also nice.

28
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,700
I think it is a bit harder in
this situation to see the trend

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,860
but it is a lot easier to see where the high points are.

30
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,560
There is one other option: 'Win/Loss'.
I am not going to talk about that

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,440
because that is what you will be doing in the exercises.
