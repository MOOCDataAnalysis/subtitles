1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,850
So this is where we left it off in the previous
video. We've taken one CSV file, and imported

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:15,529
that into Excel. But sometimes you have more
than one Excel file. In the video we have

3
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:22,089
six different XLSX files, and we would like
to import all of them. So imagine for a minute

4
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:26,939
that I've converted all of them to CSV. In
the next video I'll show you how to do that automatically.

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,810
But now let's assume I've just
converted all of them by hand. And I now have

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:38,000
six CSV files that I would like to import
into one Excel file. And, of course, I could

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,860
again use 'import', and make six different
data connections to all the CSV files. But

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,620
that is a lot of work. And we want to make
it as easy as possible. So what I'm going

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,420
to do in this video might be a little bit
scary. It's like you've been driving a car

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,740
for years, and you really know how it works,
and today we're going to open the hood and

11
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,190
change the oil. It can be a little bit scary,
because we're going to be doing a little bit

12
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,960
of programming. But don't worry, I'll be with
you every step of the way.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,810
So, here are the six CSV files in a folder.
And what we can do is, we can go to the address

14
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:20,609
bar and type 'cmd'. And what we get now is
a sort of scary looking thing that we can

15
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:26,369
use to control Windows. It's called the 'command
prompt' and here we can type in little pieces

16
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,359
of code that will do something on the computer.
So normally, you would click if you want to

17
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,880
open a file, but here you can type 'open',
and the file would open. And we can use that

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,469
to merge all the six CSV files into one. Let's
have a look at how that goes. We just type

19
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:52,219
'copy *.csv', so we get all of the CSV files
that are in the folder. And then we type 'input.csv',

20
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:57,520
and we get all of them in one file. And if
we open the file in Excel you see that we

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,959
now have all the six CSV files glued together
one underneath the other. So here we go, if

22
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,970
you scroll down you see you we have Rotterdam
and New York, and Tokyo, and Rotterdam again.

23
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:17,430
All the files are there. And it was just one
little command, just typing in 'copy' and

24
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,930
you get all of them in one file, ready to
be imported.
