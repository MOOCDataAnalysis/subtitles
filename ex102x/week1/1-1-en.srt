00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,180
Hi, welcome to EX102x.
My name if Felienne Hermans, and I'll be guiding you

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,270
through this course.
And I want to say welcome, not just to EX102x,

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,250
but also to Delft University of Technology.
Because by taking this MOOC you'll become

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,390
part of the Delft family.
The building you see here is the EWI building

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,080
on a very sunny day.
And in this building is the 'Spreadsheet Lab'.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,500
That's my research group, where with a bunch
of graduate students I research all the things

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,099
Excel.
"What is this course about?" you may ask.

8
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,769
Well, this course is about working with data
effectively.

9
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:41,019
Some people might be still doing it this way.
They print all their Excel sheets, and they

10
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:45,329
go through it and circle all the good accounts
or the nice products.

11
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,940
Which might work, but is not very effective.
So what we are going to do is: we'll help

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,920
you transform 'business need' into 'real-time
reports'.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,940
So suppose you have a question like "what
is the best product?", "what product have

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,760
we sold most this week?".
We will help you create dashboards that immediately

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,390
give an answer.
Like 'Brownies' was the most successful product.

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,940
Of course, it's not that direct.
There are lots of steps in the middle, and

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,630
all these steps will have their place in our
course.

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,960
So, suppose you have a business need, probably
you'll start with a data source.

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,680
Which can be a database, or an export from
a register system, something like this.

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,140
From a data source, we will teach you how
to import that data into Excel.

21
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,930
How to wrangle that data.
So, how to go from raw data to data that is

22
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,260
easily processable.
We'll take the next step.

23
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,600
We'll help you do analysis such that you get
nice view on the data.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,250
Because if you have a large dataset, like
the one in the picture, you want to make sure

25
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,070
you're looking in the right place.
Once we have a view, we'll teach you to put

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,360
graphs on top of it.
Nice visualizations that make it easier for

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,190
you to see what's going on.
And finally, in the last two weeks of this

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,889
course, we will glue everything together and
work on how to design a dashboard.

29
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,520
Does that look good?
See you in the rest of the course!
