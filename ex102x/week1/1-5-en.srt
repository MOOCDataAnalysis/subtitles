00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:08,010
In the previous video you have seen that we
have combined six different CSV files, using

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,450
the copy command, into one. So what we've
done is: we have taken six files into one.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,939
That is what we have done in the previous
video. And in the mean time, if you've done

4
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:23,029
the exercises, you have used that one CSV
file to import it into Excel.

5
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:27,179
However, sometimes you don't have six CSV
files.

6
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,019
Sometimes you have six Excel files.
Or ten.

7
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:34,770
Or a hundred.
And unfortunately, copy does not work on Excel

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,710
files.
By the way, if you already know that you are

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,370
not going to import Excel files because you
are always going to import CSV files, feel

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,510
free to skip this video.
It is just about the conversion of Excel to

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,750
CSV.
However, don't skip the next video.

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,570
It's about data types, and you'll need to
know about that in both of the scenarios.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,660
So if you're still here I assume you want
to know how to transform Excel files into

14
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:05,369
CSV files so that we can then use 'copy' and
'import' and get everything into Excel.

15
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,270
So, how to do that.
Of course, as you have seen me do in previous

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,060
videos, we can do it manually.
We can open every file, 'save as', 'CSV',

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,020
and then we'll be there.
But that is a lot of work.

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:23,229
So, to make it easier for you I have made
a little script. A VBS script, that is: a

19
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:29,240
'Visual Basic' script.
And we can use that to automatically transform

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,380
all of the Excel files to CSV files.
That's what I will show you in this video.

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,799
So here you see the script.
We will place a download link below.

22
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,340
And if you just click it, there it is running
now in the background,

23
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,869
we get all of the CSV files.
Now we have them, we can again repeat the

24
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:53,959
same trick that we did in the previous video.
We just copy all the CSV files into one.

25
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,810
There we go.
Now we have an input file.

26
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,639
Because you have already made the data connection
to this input file, we can just open that.

27
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:07,459
We go here, click 'Refresh', and all the data
is there.

28
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,830
Very easy.
One more thing I want to show you.

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,510
If you click properties, there it says 'refresh
on open', and that is something you really

30
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,980
want to enable.
Because that means every time you open the

31
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,790
Excel file,
all of the data connections,

32
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,510
in this case we just have one, our one data
connection is refreshed.

33
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:32,000
So you can never forget to update anything.
You just convert everything, copy, and then

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,470
always if you open the latest data will be
loaded.

35
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,890
Isn't that easy?!
