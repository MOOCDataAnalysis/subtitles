1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,290
In the previous video we've imported data.
So we've gone from a data source to the raw

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,040
data.
However, we need some data wrangling still.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,520
And maybe you've noticed in the exercises
that our data isn't exactly perfect.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,259
Like crude oil it needs some refinement, in
order to be processable for further data analysis.

5
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:29,570
So one of the things you might have noticed
is here.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:35,910
If we go to line 1578.
Let's go there with 'goto', that you can bring

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,450
up with F5.
You see that the headers are repeated.

8
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:47,200
Because we have merged the six CSV files into
one, also the headers are replicated.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,890
Do you know how to fix this?
Maybe you have seen this in a previous MOOC

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,120
or somewhere else.
There are a few techniques you can use to

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,390
get rid of this duplication.
There will be a little quiz afterwards where

12
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,850
you can show us whether you know how to fix
this.

13
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,700
Okay, welcome back.
But there are some worse scenarios in our

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,420
data.
For example, if we look at 'loyalty', some

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,729
of them have a loyalty number, and others
have three dashes.

16
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,450
So if we add some analysis on top of that,
naively,

17
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,979
let's calculate how many purchases there are
without loyalty card.

18
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,939
If we would do that, just by looking at the
first few rows, we would do a 'COUNTIF' on

19
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:37,369
column K, on all of the loyalties, and we
would count everywhere where it is three dashes.

20
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:42,289
But unfortunately this is not the correct
value, because if we look at 'loyalty', and

21
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:47,560
the easy way to find this is adding a filter.
If we scroll back, if we look at 'loyalty'

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,119
here we see that some of the values are zero.
So this is probably not loyalty card number

23
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,810
zero that is making all these purchases.
In some of the branches they are saving loyalty

24
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,829
as zero instead of three dashes.
So what we can do is we can use some calculation

25
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:11,690
to make the data look more consistent.
What we can do is we go to 'loyalty'.

26
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,430
There we go.
To 'loyalty'.

27
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,470
And we make a 'loyalty processed' column.
Where we are going to say "okay, in one of

28
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:28,420
these three scenarios, either it is black,
or it is zero, or it is three dashes.

29
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,080
In one of these three scenarios we are going
to give back one value."

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,760
Doesn't really matter which one we pick.
Let's here pick three dashes.

31
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,670
There we go.
Three dashes in that scenario.

32
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,190
And otherwise, we are going to we are going
to give the loyalty value.

33
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,400
So if we use that formula, we can drag it
down.

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,680
There we go.
And now you see that, everywhere, even if

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,970
the loyalty is zero, we get three dashes.
And also if the loyalty is blank, in any case

36
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,930
we get three dashes.
Nice and consistent.

37
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,820
Whatever is in column K, column L will look
nice.

38
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,100
So one thing to notice here is that I'm now
doing this in the input sheet.

39
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,670
I'm putting it right next to the input data.
I'm just doing that because this is a video

40
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,070
and it's a lot of work to switch the worksheets
all the time.

41
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,040
Normally, and this is what you are going to
do in the exercises as well, you would put

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,430
it in a separate worksheet, because you want
to separate input data and formulas.

43
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,830
This is just an example.
This is not how you normally do it.

44
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,400
What you might also have noticed is that there
are even worse things wrong with our data.

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,380
If we go here to the 'Sales Price', we select
that, again we can easily use a filter to

46
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,360
see all the values that are there.
Some of the values have a dollar sign, where

47
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,260
others do not have a dollar sign.
And you might think "is this a problem or

48
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,950
not?"
We can ask Excel.

49
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,320
So we can ask "are these two values the same?"
And Excel says 'true', yes, both of them are

50
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,710
the same.
So it's just a layout issue.

51
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,150
It's not really a problem.
One thing though, is really a problem.

52
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:13,510
Some of these values have commas in them.
Let's select one.

53
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,060
And we want to know: "is this a problem?"
So one of the things you can always try, to

54
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,949
see if values are normal, is to do some calculation
with them.

55
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,889
If we add these two values... huh? It is not
working!

56
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,379
Why could that be?
Well, one of the guesses we can take is that,

57
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:34,509
maybe this is a text value.
And we can ask Excel "hey, is this a text?"

58
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:37,680
Do you also think this is text?
"Yes!" says Excel.

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,819
It is true that this is text.
And that means that at least we know what

60
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:45,729
is wrong.
And I'll show you one formula that you can

61
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:51,499
use to convert text to numbers if Excel hasn't
done it automatically.

62
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:55,550
Because sometimes it just goes naturally.
Let me show you how that works.

63
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,659
So we're going to get rid of this text, we
don't need that anymore.

64
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,659
Let's delete that.
What we're going to do is the 'NUMBERVALUE'

65
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:05,860
function.
Where you can put in a text, we know now that

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,460
this is text.
So we can put it in.

67
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,560
And then we can say what is the decimal separator
in this number.

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,659
So, in this case, of course you've seen that,
it is a comma.

69
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:20,879
And if we close that formula off, we get a
nice value.

70
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,029
100, a real value.
And you can drag that down.

71
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:29,020
Here I'm just doing it over the filter, but
of course you can do it over all of the rows.

72
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,379
And just to verify that we've done it correctly
we can add a formula on top of it and then

73
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:37,550
we see, yes, it is real data.
Because if we add a hundred to a hundred we

74
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,699
get two hundred, in stead of '#VALUE' like
we got before.

75
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:48,469
So, your exercise to close of this week is
to clean all of this data in order to prepare

76
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:51,460
for the data analysis that we will be doing
next week.

77
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,080
Good luck!
