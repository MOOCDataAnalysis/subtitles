1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
We are going to import data, and the first
thing we need to import data is to get

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:14,660
our data into a CSV format, a 'comma separated values' format. So you might think

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,859
"how am I going to get my data into a CSV
file?"

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,460
Well, the easiest thing that you can do
that maybe you haven't thought of is

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,449
ask your colleagues: the people that are
now emailing you spreadsheets. Maybe they

6
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,090
can supply you with CSV files
instead. Many database systems can easily

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,629
export also to CSV. It really
won't be a silly question if you ask

8
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:42,559
your colleagues "hey, would it be possible
to email me a CSV file instead?"

9
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,940
That is an option. If you cannot do that, then
suppose you already have your data in

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,289
Excel, you can also do the transformation
yourself. It's not that hard. You just

11
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,969
open your spreadsheet and you save it
as a CSV file. There we go, we save

12
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:03,890
and then we select, instead of XLSX file, we
scroll down and we pick CSV. And then we get

13
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,820
our data in a CSV file. Excel gives us a
warning: "hey! Be careful! Formulas

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,680
and pivot tables will be removed if you
convert to CSV." But that is OK, we don't

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,869
need them. And now, like we did in the
previous MOOC where we imported

16
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:23,270
data from the web, we can import data
from the CSV file now. So we pick

17
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,850
"delimited", and we tell excel at our
data has headers. Because the first row

18
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,619
is a header row. And even though it's
called a CSV file, we still have to tell

19
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:37,049
Ecxel that commas are the separators
between the columns. So we get a nice

20
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,520
little preview now, and here we can set
the data types. So we say this is 'text' and

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,500
this is 'text'. All the other 'text' as well,
but I guess you believe that.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,780
And here we have a 'date'. So we have to
tell Excel: "be careful, this is a 'date'!"

23
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,840
and also say that it is month-day-year.
Then it knows how to interpret it.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,090
Maybe you want to click OK now, but don't do
that! We have to go to the properties

25
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,829
first, because there is one important
property here that we need to remove.

26
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:09,709
We don't want Excel to ask for the file
name upon refresh. If we would click that

27
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:12,910
then every time we click 'Refresh', Excel
will ask us:

28
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:19,490
"What is the file name?" So we want to disable
that. And there we go. Now we have all the data from

29
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:26,050
the CSV file into our Excel file at once.
And suppose we have that annoying colleague

30
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,680
again that emailed us "here is a new updated version." That is no trouble for us anymore.

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Because what we can just do is:
we open the file... Oh, let me show you that we

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,360
have 753 rows now. That will be important
later. ...we open the file, the second file

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,090
that our colleague sent us. And we can
just save this file again as a CSV file.

34
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,780
There we go. We scroll down, we pick 'CSV',
and now we pick the file that is

35
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,250
already there. we overwrite it. Yes Excel, we
know. We are OK. We know what we are doing with the warning:

36
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,070
We can close it! And now
the second file is saved as a CSV file.

37
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,150
So we just click 'Refresh', and the data is
loaded. Let us scroll down, you can see

38
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,950
that we now got five extra rows. So,
without any copy-pasting, without

39
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,800
deleting any data. We just make sure that
we're pointing to the same filename we

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,010
click 'Refresh', and all the data is there.
Isn't that nice?!
