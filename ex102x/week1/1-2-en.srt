00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,920
So, new MOOC, new shop!
this week we are the owners of a shop that

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,860
sells running materials. So running socks,
shoes, bra's, and pants.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:16,059
We are going to analyze how we are doing.
This week we are talking about how to import data.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,720
So we assume we have some sort of data source,

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,910
an ERP system or a database, and we want to get the data into our spreadsheet.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,019
So I am guessing that your current scenario
for importing data is something like this.

7
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,730
People are just emailing you spreadsheets
and you have to make sense of it.

8
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,190
Ultimately that leads to something like this.
You have a folder on your hard drive with

9
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,879
a number of excel files and you have to analyze
all of them together.

10
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,829
So what you probably will do is something
like this.

11
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:51,760
You import the data. You click on one of the
files.

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,559
It opens. You select all the data, which is
very easy.

13
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,270
You go to the sheet that you want to do your
analysis in, and you paste the data.

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,679
And you repeat this for another file.
We want to have the data of Japan as well.

15
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:09,789
So there we go.
We select all the data. Control-C, Control-V,

16
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:13,560
and we paste it in.
So suppose we have six files, we will repeat

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,639
this six times.
I guess you understand what that would look like.

18
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:19,639
This is not all that bad.

19
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:22,950
If we only had to do it once it would probably
be okay.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,849
But what you can also have is a situation
like this.

21
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:32,340
Someone sends you an email saying: "Oh, I'm
sorry, the file I sent was not the right file.

22
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,079
Here is the right file."
And this is where it starts to get tricky.

23
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,929
Because you have to open your excel sheet
again.

24
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:42,989
Select the data that you want to replace,
delete it, and put in the new data.

25
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,909
That is very error prone.
Maybe you will overwrite an existing row.

26
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:50,469
Maybe you will delete too much.
That is not what you want.

27
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,889
You will be like: "R U kidding? I'm not going
to do all of that again."

28
00:01:54,889 --> 00:02:02,239
So this week I will show you how to automatically
import as many excel files as you want into

29
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,309
one source file.
