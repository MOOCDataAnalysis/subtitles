00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:07,460
Hello everybody!
Last time we looked at the charts to measure

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,000
the sales, operating profit, and the margin,
and they were all vertically oriented.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,670
But of course we can do the same, but than
in stead of a column chart make a bar chart

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,710
from it.
And that's what we're going to do in the 'cost'

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,460
chart.
So let's have a look in Excel how we're going

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,269
to do that.
So, here we are in our file.

7
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:35,270
And I immediately went to the 'cost' sheet.
Here I have all the information, all the cost

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,110
elements, and the actual value, and the budget
value.

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:55,310
And we're going to create a chart from that.
There we are.

10
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,360
And then I need to do the trick with the 'ctrl'
button.

11
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,829
There we are.
So I've selected the data.

12
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,690
I've selected the cost elements, the categories,
and I've selected the numbers.

13
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:17,420
And I'm going to say 'insert', 'bar chart',
'2D bar.'

14
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,500
And there we are.
We know from the last time that the trick

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,409
we have to do is:
we select the actual range, we right-mouse

16
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:32,110
click.
And we're going to format that data series.

17
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,299
And we're going to put in on the secondary
axis.

18
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,640
So there we are.
We have to play a little bit with the gap

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,100
width.
We're going to change this one to 200%.

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,420
And now I want to select also the other series,
but I have to be very careful, and I don't

21
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,380
like that.
Luckily I can also select (over here) a different

22
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,770
data series.
I'm going to 'series two'.

23
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:09,409
And I will change the value over here to 50.
And this is kind of OK, but of course we have

24
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:15,440
the same scaling problem.
So, we're going to format the axes a little

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:27,120
bit.
And in this case I want to have a hard coded

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:39,480
maximum of two million.
I'm going to do the same over here.

27
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:52,040
Then, I don't need this one.
And now I have still one problem.

28
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:07,430
[Which] is that the data is not sorted correctly.
The easiest way to do that is to sort it over

29
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,860
here.
There are other ways to do it, but this will

30
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:20,360
do the trick.
We're going to sort it on column C, the 'actuals.'

31
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,390
And now it's ranked from high to low.
I like to have that in a chart.

32
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:32,319
Get rid of the title.
Get rid of the legend.

33
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:43,300
Get rid of the grid lines.
Also, I want to change these big numbers.

34
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:53,800
So we're going to change the number format
again.

35
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:06,019
And I want to have that in thousands.
So a single comma should do the trick.

36
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:13,360
There we are.
And then we have to adjust the format.

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,310
But then I have to select the chart area.
I can also change the format over here.

38
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:30,610
We want to it to be 2.15 and, our well known,
2.27.

39
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:38,520
And then we should get rid of any fill that
is left there.

40
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,820
No border.
No fill.

41
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:49,370
Oh, and we still have a very ugly color.
That we will change with this color.

42
00:04:49,370 --> 00:05:00,050
To keep it consistent.
There we are.

43
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:09,840
And we're almost ready.
We go back to our dashboard.

44
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:22,300
And we will put it in over here.
And these are 'costs.'

45
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:29,080
And that should be a little bit larger font.
Twenty.

46
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,400
There we are.
Get rid of this.

47
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,770
And another chart filled.
So.

48
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,830
The cost graph is also there.
Now, let's have a look [at] what we will see

49
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,300
in the next video.
In the next video we're leaving the charts

50
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,710
behind for a moment,
and we're going to look at a full profit and

51
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,500
loss statement in a table.
And that is going to be interesting, I promise

52
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,360
you.
See you then!
