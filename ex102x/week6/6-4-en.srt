00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,340
Hello everybody!
Ready for our next chart?

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,120
We're going to look at the average order size.
Maybe you remember for last week that there

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,570
are three basic charts.
We have a bar chart, or column chart.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,130
We have a line chart, and we have a scatter
[plot].

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,009
The scatter you won't see in the dashboard.
The reason is that this is a business dashboard,

6
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:28,980
and normally we do not use a scatter plot
a lot, because we do not have to explain relations

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,250
between objects or variables.
So we started with a bar chart, and now we

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,540
go to the next basic chart, which is the column
chart.

9
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,540
It's going to be the 'average order size.'
I would take a short moment to look at the

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,060
x-axis.
There we see the periods, and the periods

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:54,930
consist of 2015-06 to 2016-06.
And there are two things notable.

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,780
That you do not need to repeat (for every
label) the year.

13
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,600
If you start with the year and end with the
year it is very clear for the reader that

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,840
these are months in a year.
And you save a little bit of space.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,850
Because what I don't want to see is text that
is vertically aligned or that is rotated.

16
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,479
I just want to have normal, plain text.
The second thing you see is: if you ask people

17
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:26,009
to make some kind of trend overview, they
normally will select twelve periods.

18
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,840
Because that's a whole year.
What I did over here, and what I did in every

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,359
trend chart in the dashboard, is: I selected
13 months.

20
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:43,329
And the reason that I do that is that if I
choose 13 months I can compare this year with

21
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,340
last year.
And that is what you see in the chart.

22
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:52,600
You see 2016-06, and we can compare it with
2015-06.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,560
So that's a small tip: use 13 periods.
Now let's see how we can create that ourselves

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:07,170
in Excel.
We need to have the 'average order size.'

25
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,370
Here is the raw data.
Just a very quick moment, because what you

26
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:18,940
remember (maybe) from the chart, is that in
2015-06, there was a hard return.

27
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,340
And this is the way how you do it.
I have the year, I have the month, and in

28
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,440
between I put character 13, which is a hard
return.

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,830
And that makes it possible to get the year
on one row and the period on the other row.

30
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,880
The rest is easy.
So here I have my data.

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:51,780
I want to have my average order size.
So I'm going to select that.

32
00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:00,350
My normal strategy for creating a chart is
just select the data, and then insert the

33
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,590
graph, or the chart.
And in this case I want to have a column chart.

34
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,690
Again 2D.
And here it is.

35
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,430
And I made a little mistake, so we're going
to delete that, because it would be nice if

36
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:23,270
we instruct Excel what should be the x-axis.
That should be the periods.

37
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:40,620
And then I use the 'ctrl' button again, and
the 'ctrl' button is playing tricks on me today..

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,820
There it is.

39
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,790
So now I have the two ranges.
One for the x-axis and one for the average

40
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,080
order size.
I say insert, column chart, column, and there

41
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,260
we are.
And I see that now I have a nice x-axis.

42
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,320
First thing that I notice is that I have my
title again.

43
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,400
I will remove it.
I still don't like the whitespace, so we're

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:20,180
going to change that to 75%.
Actually, what I should have done, also on

45
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,870
the other chart, is I should make it a little
bit smaller.

46
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,030
Because we really have to fight for space
on our dashboard.

47
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:49,050
So normally I make it 8 points.
I don't need the grid lines.

48
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,599
And I don't want to have a fill.
So most of the times we are changing the same

49
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:57,560
things.
I don't want to have a fill.

50
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,449
To be sure, I don't want to have a border,
because sometimes if I leave it on automatic

51
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:08,889
Excel will add it.
Now, I still remember the dimensions of my

52
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,110
chart.
So I'm going to change them.

53
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:28,430
They were 2.15 by 2.27.
And it should be the right format.

54
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,960
Now, it's still a bit crowded over here, in
the x-axis.

55
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:39,629
So, what I could do is..
So I selected it, I can check that I selected

56
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:44,740
it over here.
And now I can say that I want to have my labels

57
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:52,870
on a specific interval, which is three.
Which makes it less crowded.

58
00:05:52,870 --> 00:06:00,249
And I think I'm quite happy now with my chart.
So I'm going to copy it.

59
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:16,870
Go back to my dashboard.
And it can go next to our previous chart.

60
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:24,059
We will specify that it is the order sizes
in '1 X $',

61
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:34,729
and we have to say that this is the 'average
order size.'

62
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:42,490
There we are.
OK, so that was the average order size.

63
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,259
So we have the 'sales by category', we have
the 'average order size.'

64
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:50,580
We have two of our charts, but you see we
have still a lot of empty white spaces.

65
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,779
In the next video we're going to have a look
at the 'sales trend.'

66
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,979
We're going to have a new chart type.
See you then!
