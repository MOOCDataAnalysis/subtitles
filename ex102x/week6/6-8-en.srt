00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,170
Hello everybody!
And welcome back.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:09,170
In contrast to the previous videos, in this
video we're not going to focus on a chart

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:14,290
but we're going to focus on a table.
What we see over here is a full profit and

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,590
loss statement.
When you see it you think: "well, that's easy.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,750
That's just: we create it in Excel, copy,
paste, done."

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:30,779
But, we design our dashboard with a grid.
And I can promise you: that grid is

7
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,720
not going to match with the column layout
of this table.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,880
Nevertheless we want to have it in.
And now you see the grid lines behind the

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,500
table, and you see what kind of mess it is.
So we have to find a solution for that.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,590
And that solution I'm going to show you in
Excel.

11
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,579
So here we have our table.
If you have a look at the file yourself you

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:59,090
can see how we get all that information in
with the 'SUMIF's.

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,250
But what we want to do is: we want to copy
that data into our dashboard.

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:13,659
And that is how we start.
So I will select everything that I need.

15
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:25,930
'ctrl+c', and it is copied.
And I go to my dashboard, I position the cursor

16
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:28,880
on the right place.
In this cell, there I want to have it.

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,630
And I'm going to paste it.
But you can imagine, if I paste it.. Let's

18
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:39,700
do it, than you can see it.
If I paste it, it's going to be one ugly mess.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,189
So we don't want to do that.
So, we do 'ctrl+z', to undo this.

20
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:51,900
We're going to select the cell, and instead
of pasting I'm now going to say 'I want to

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:02:01,079
paste it as a 'linked picture.'
And that's a very nice feature.

22
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,079
In previous versions of Excel it was hidden
very deep.

23
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,109
It was called the 'camera tool'.
But now it is on our 'paste special' menu,

24
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:15,870
and it's this option, the 'linked picture.'
And what's very nice about this is..

25
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:23,230
Here it is.
It behaves as a picture, so if we want we

26
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,219
could rotate it,
but it is still linked to the data.

27
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:33,239
So if I change something in the data, let's
do that, because I don't like the black negative

28
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,909
numbers, these should be red.
So we're going to change that.

29
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:49,959
So, over here I'm going to select all the
numeric values.

30
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:59,299
'ctrl+1' gives us the shortcut to the cell
properties.

31
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:11,150
And now I'm going to say: 'I want to have
it like this.'

32
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,919
But now the numbers are too big, so we have
to adjust that a little bit by saying that

33
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:27,680
we want to have them in thousands.
And the 'red' after the semicolon is telling

34
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,829
us that if the value if negative it should
be red.

35
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:37,839
So, if I do it like that, and I go back to
my dashboard it should be reflected in my

36
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:50,040
funny rotated linked picture.
Let's see if we can get it straight again.

37
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,799
There it is.
And we have to adjust the format a little

38
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,459
bit.
And here I use the 'alt' button again to make

39
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:09,040
sure it will move with the grid.
And then I will cheat a little bit.

40
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,779
And there we have our data.
And it's linked, so if any of the figures

41
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:21,189
change, the table will also change.
And what we should do is get rid of some of

42
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:25,620
the mock-up titles.
So we will remove this chart title, the chart

43
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:36,860
footer, chart title, chart footer.
And area title. And area title.

44
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,669
The rest we will clean up later on.
But here we have our table.

45
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,400
So that was something different.
Not a chart but a table.

46
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,259
Let's see what the next video is going to
be [about].

47
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:56,569
There we're going to work with something you
also saw in one of the earlier lectures, the

48
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,250
sparklines.
See you then!
