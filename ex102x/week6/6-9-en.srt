00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:04,029
Hello everybody!
In this video we're going to focus on the

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:08,240
sparklines.
And we combine it with a top-ten list.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,880
Here you see a detailed [view] of it.
So, I have two top-ten lists.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,960
I have a top-ten list of all the customers,
with their sales.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,340
And I have a top-ten list of the product,
with their sales.

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,030
But they're both year-to-date figures, so
I also want to see somehow a little bit the

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,830
trend.
And for that we use a sparkline.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,550
So let's see in Excel how we can create this.
So we're back in our file.

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,960
We need to have the two top-ten lists over
here.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,480
And the data is prepared, of course.
Here we have our customer top-ten.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:57,300
And the trick I did is that I use the top-ten
functionality of Excel, of the PivotTable.

12
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:02,109
In the filter, you can choose a top-ten.
And that's what we did.

13
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:09,299
So that means that I always have 10 values.
And then I use a lookup function, an index

14
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,740
function to get the data replicated over here.
So that I can paste it into my dashboard.

15
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:23,880
And I need some supporting data of the last
twelve months, for the sparklines.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,020
So the sparklines is the first object we're
going to create.

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:33,490
It should go over here, so I'm going to select
the trend column.

18
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:42,929
And then I say: 'insert,' a spark.. not a
sparkline, but a column-sparkline.

19
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,310
And then it want's to know where the data
is located.

20
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,770
So the nice thing you can do with a sparkline
is that you can select a whole group.

21
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,920
And then you select the data that goes with
it.

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,560
There we are.
And it will create the sparklines.

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,880
And what is very nice, is that the sparklines
are now organized in a group.

24
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,060
So I can change the properties of the sparklines
with one step.

25
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,140
And I want to have a different color.
The ugly one.

26
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,120
There we are.
Ah.. I think for this one we can also use

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,830
this one.
So that's the sparkline.

28
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,250
And then we're going to treat it exactly the
same as we did with the P&L table.

29
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:44,330
I'm going to select it.
I'm going back to the dashboard.

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:56,400
I position my cursor.
And again I paste it as a 'linked picture.'

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:06,370
And I adjust the size a little bit.
There we are.

32
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,620
And now we have to do the same for the product
top-ten.

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:26,780
We select the trend column again.
We insert a sparkline.

34
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:44,480
Select the data.
Adjust the color.

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:56,980
And copy the table.
Back to our dashboard.

36
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:05,330
And we paste it again, as a 'linked picture.'
And as a final step we have to adjust the

37
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:24,010
size a little bit.
There we are.

38
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,160
So we're almost done now.
So, we're almost there.

39
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,700
All the charts are filled.
There is one [bit of] trouble.

40
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,930
There is one problem.
To the right we have a white empty place for

41
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,950
a legend.
And that is something you can figure out yourself

42
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,050
how you can copy that in.
The hint that I'll give you is that you can

43
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,770
also use a linked picture.
And if you look in the file, you will find

44
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,950
a sheet that is labeled 'legend,' where you'll
find an area that you can copy.

45
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,740
And the other thing you have to do is you
have to clean up the colors a little bit.

46
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,100
Because this is looking very ugly.
We only needed that to visualize our grid.

47
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,470
But this is how we would like to see it.
So we want to have some gray background behind

48
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,070
the graphs, and all the other colors should
go.

49
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:23,350
And we see your legend to the right.
And that brings us to the end of this series

50
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,090
of videos.
We have to surprises for you, two little bonuses

51
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:33,240
that you can have a look at.
But I would like to end with this slide.

52
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:41,000
That is: we spent a lot of time doing all
kinds of tricks and making a nice dashboard

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,310
in Excel.
But what is really important is that before

54
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,389
you start doing anything in Excel is that
you really think: "what is the information

55
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,290
that I need to present to the driver behind
my dashboard?"

56
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:58,169
So, I hope you enjoyed it.
I hope to see some of you back in the bonus

57
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,889
videos.
And otherwise, see you next time!
