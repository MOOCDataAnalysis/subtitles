00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,340
Hello everybody!
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,749
In this video we're going to look at new chart
type.

3
00:00:06,749 --> 00:00:11,570
Actually it's a chart we already know.
It's a column chart, but we use it in a very

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:18,240
special way, so that we very easily can compare
actual and budget in just one column.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,779
So, it looks like this.
And let's see how we can create this in Excel.

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:34,820
So, we're back in our dashboard.
We go to the 'sales' slide.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,520
Almost no data, because we only have two numbers.
We have the actual sales, or the actual revenue,

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,640
and the budget revenue.
That's what I select.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,370
And I'm going to say 'insert', and in this
case, a column chart.

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:01:01,710
Now, what I need, the trick I want to do,
and maybe we have an example over here, is:

11
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,820
I want to move this one behind that one.
But I can only do that if this is a separate

12
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,400
series.
And now it's one series, with two categories.

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,830
So we have to change that.
And you can do this with this magic button.

14
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,320
So I go to the chart tools.
Design, switch row and column.

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,060
And if I do that I immediately see that there
are two different ranges.

16
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:39,470
Now, we're going to change this one to the
ugly but clearly visible color.

17
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:48,170
There we are.
We get rid of the title.

18
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,250
And now we have to move them behind each other.
And we have to do a trick for that.

19
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,850
I'm going to select the 'actual' series.
Right-mouse click.

20
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:05,430
Format data series.
And I'm going to say 'OK, you have to display

21
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,009
this series on the secondary axis.'
And now you see they are just behind each

22
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:16,220
other.
But imagine that my budget would be lower,

23
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:23,400
then I wouldn't see it.
So somehow, I have to make the actual bar,

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,880
or the actual column smaller.
And we can do that by using the 'gap width.'

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:43,670
So I make this one 200.
And I will make this one 50.

26
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:52,209
So this is kind of OK, but my budget is lower
than my actual, and here it is higher.

27
00:02:52,209 --> 00:03:00,890
And that's because we have two different axes,
and the scale is different.

28
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,870
For years now, I'm waiting for Microsoft to
somehow automate this, but they don't do that.

29
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,730
So we have to do it ourselves.
So I'm going to select this axis.

30
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:20,640
And I'm going to say the total should be six
million.

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:31,980
And I do exactly the same over here.
So I have new values over here.

32
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:39,950
And now I have two exactly the same axes.
And now we can see that 'budget' indeed is

33
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,819
lower than 'actual'.
So, this has no function anymore.

34
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:49,470
We can get rid of it.
I don't need the grid lines.

35
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,010
Get rid of that.
But I don't like these large numbers.

36
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,260
So I'm going to change the number format of
it.

37
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:05,129
We can do that over here: 'number.'
We say it also in the last week.

38
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:14,930
We can work with a custom number format.
There we are.

39
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:31,900
And in this case I'm going to say.. with a
thousand separator at the end.

40
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:42,690
And actually I need two because I want to
have it in millions.

41
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:47,669
Now I have it in millions.
I don't need this '1.'

42
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:58,990
We can get rid of it.
There we are.

43
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:05,770
Now I just have to adjust the format.
And here we have another trick.

44
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:29,930
Because if we look at our dashboard, we now
need over here three separate charts.

45
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:41,690
So it should be a little bit smaller.
It should be again 2.15 high, but now .76

46
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,790
wide.
And I need some kind of axis, so I'm going

47
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:58,740
to say (over here) that I want tick-marks
outside the major level.

48
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,930
And now I have a very nice chart.
Of course it's still filled.

49
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,880
We don't want that.
We want to control that ourselves.

50
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,580
So we change that.
And we cut that.

51
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:24,500
And we're going to paste that in our dashboard.
There we are.

52
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,220
And this was 'sales.'
So.

53
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:38,120
We have done that now for one chart.
We could very easily do that also for the

54
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,979
'operating profit' and the 'margin,' as you
can see on the slide.

55
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:47,229
But that is something you can do yourselves.
For each video, the file we're working on,

56
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:54,710
you can download it from there.
Even if you have skipped a file, we make sure

57
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,850
that every time you have a file with exactly
the right starting point to do this exercise.

58
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,520
So you can do it yourselves and you can try
to get the other two charts in.

59
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,520
So, what will be in the next video?
We have created such a chart in a vertical

60
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,630
position.
But we can also create it in a horizontal

61
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,639
position.
And that will be the next video.

62
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,139
See you then!
