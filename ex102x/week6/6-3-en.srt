00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,259
Hello everybody!
So here we have our big dashboard that we're

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,709
going to design.
In this video we're going to focus on the

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:16,640
very first graph: sales by category.
So let's have a closer look at that.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,840
I think it is the most easy chart we're going
to do today, and I think 90% of the people

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,890
that had to present this data would have used
a pie chart.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,840
But probably you are not among this 90% because
you followed the lecture from last week [previous

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,699
lecture], and you know pies should be reserved
for desert.

8
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:40,699
But, we still want to explain the same kind
of message here,

9
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:45,790
that we have three broad categories of sales:
vegetables, dairy, and meat.

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,290
And we want to know the relative part of each
category.

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,690
And that is the reason that I choose to put
the percentages as a label into the graph.

12
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,890
So, let's have a look in Excel how we can
accomplish this.

13
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:09,230
So, here we are back in our file.
We need to have our very first chart.

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:19,380
As a rule every chart I'm going to create
in my dashboard will have it's own sheet.

15
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,270
In this case I need the sheet with the sales
details.

16
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,670
Here I have my three categories with the three
percentages.

17
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:40,940
I'm going to select them.
I'm going to insert a chart.

18
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:46,520
And in this case we use one of the basic charts,
which is the bar chart.

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,960
And we always use a 2D bar.
Never 3D.

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,040
Here I have my default Excel bar chart.
It's rather OK.

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,479
But it's not going to fit in our dashboard.
So we have to make some adjustments.

22
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,170
The title, you can use a title in your chart,
but I normally don't do that.

23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:16,980
I use Excel cells for that.
So I'm going to get rid of the chart [title].

24
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,920
I think that the gap between, the whitespace
between the bars, to my taste it is a bit

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,010
too much.
So I'm going to change that.

26
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:35,620
I will select the range, I hit the right mouse-button.
And I'm going to format the data series.

27
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:43,490
I get a nice screen over here.
Here I can influence the gap width.

28
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:49,610
And I want to have less white, so therefore
I have to lesser [decrease] the percentage.

29
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:57,760
I go to 75%, and I think that looks quite
nice.

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,550
Then I need to know how big my chart should
be.

31
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,880
I have a little trick for that.
I'm going to show you that.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:24,709
I have my dashboard over here.
I will insert a rectangle. Put it over here.

33
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:31,720
We have to see, I think the chart has to come
over here, but we can check that later on.

34
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,739
Now, there is a little trick.
If I move an object within an Excel sheet,

35
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,290
and before I do that hit the 'alt' button,
which I'm doing now on the keyboard.

36
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:50,270
If I then start moving it will align immediately
to the cells.

37
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:58,690
And that makes it very easy to make this rectangle
exactly as big as the placeholder for my chart.

38
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,319
Now I can see over here the format is 2.15"
by 2.27".

39
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,970
I'm going to use that to create exactly the
right format for my chart.

40
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:21,319
So, we delete that [rectangle] again.
We go back to our 'sales details'.

41
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:26,759
I will select the chart.
You can see it over here

42
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,979
Go to the format.
I can see over here that the chart area is

43
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:45,000
selected, and that is what I need.
I need it to be 2.15" by 2.27".

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,409
Now it is the right format.
The trouble now: it's solid white, and I don't

45
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:55,650
like that.
So I'm going to remove the background.

46
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,159
So I'm going to format the chart area.
I get my formatting screen over here.

47
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:07,180
I go to the fill, and I say I do not want
to have any fill.

48
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,819
I will check the border because I also like
to not have a border.

49
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,289
In this case "less is more" we said, so I'm
going to get rid of the grid lines.

50
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,800
They are not that important.
And what we still need is the data label over

51
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:33,509
here.
So I'm going to select the range.

52
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:50,509
I'm going to add an object to my graph.
I'm going to say I need data labels.

53
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,610
Then they're outside my bars.
I don't like that. I want them inside.

54
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:01,569
So I select them.
I can see over here that they're selected.

55
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,460
Now I say I want to have them on the inside,
at the base.

56
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,080
But black on blue, that's not that good.
So we have to change the font.

57
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,899
So I go from 'label options' to 'text options'
to 'text fill', and I'm going to change the

58
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,969
color to white.
There we are.

59
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:29,610
Now I'm going to select my chart.
I will cut it with 'ctrl+x'.

60
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:36,619
I will go to my dashboard.
I will select the right cell.

61
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:43,139
We will have a little peak at the final result
to see where it goes.

62
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,550
It should go over there.
So we go back.

63
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,189
Get rid of this.
So this is my last column, so it should be

64
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:56,830
over here.
And if I position my cursor on the right cell

65
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:05,039
I can just paste it in, and it will fit immediately
exactly in the place that I reserved for it.

66
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:19,189
And in this case it will be 'sales by category.'
It's always nice to say that it is in percentages.

67
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:27,610
Here we are, this is our result.
Next week, or in the next video, we're going

68
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,879
to do an additional chart, which is the 'average
order size.'

69
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,499
See you then!
