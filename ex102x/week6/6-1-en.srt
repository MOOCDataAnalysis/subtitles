Hello everybody!
Welcome in the next week of the course.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,969
Last week we looked at the design of tables
and graphs,

3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:14,549
and today we will have a look at dashboard
design.

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,750
Last week one of the central points we discussed
was that when you are going to design a table,

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,930
or when you are going to design a graph, you
have to really think about "who's going to

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,750
be my audience", and "what kind of message
do I want to tell."

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,109
And "what is the goal of my graph", or "what
is the goal of my table."

8
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,719
But now we have a dashboard.
And we have many tables and many graphs.

9
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,819
So we have to think a bit about what should
be the goal or the message.

10
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:48,300
Dashboards, we know them from planes from
a cockpit.

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:57,229
We know them from cars, very beautiful cars.
And the question is: "why do we need a dashboard?"

12
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:02,190
Why does a plane have a dashboard?
Why does a car have a dashboard?

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,940
And if you think a little bit about it,
then [you realize that] there is somebody behind the dashboard.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,090
And that person wants to go from A to B.
And it needs to steer the machine.

15
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:19,920
Either the plane or the car.
And to do so, it needs information.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,420
If you are going to design a dashboard to
present your quantitative data you should

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,440
ask yourself the same question.
Who's going to sit behind my dashboard?

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:37,230
And what is he or she going to control?
Will that be an organization, or a process,

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:43,600
or a research project?
If you know what has to be controlled, the

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,160
next question is: "what kind of information
do I need, so that I really can control my

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,920
organization or my process?"
So that's what we're going to focus on today.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,640
I will show you a lot of tips and tricks how
you can do that in Excel, but actually, for

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,890
me, this is the most important message of
the whole series of videos:

24
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,590
That before you start working in Excel, or
any other software, you should really think

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,890
"what should be on my dashboard? What is needed
to control the process that I will give information

26
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,160
about?"
So what are we going to do today?

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,569
We're going to have a look at this dashboard.
It's completely built in Excel, and we're

28
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,230
going to build it together, step by step.
We will start with an empty spreadsheet, and

29
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,950
we will fill -gradually- the whole dashboard.
So, see you in the next video!
