00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello everybody!
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,740
We're going to have a look at the next chart.
That is the a combined chart.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,490
It is the sales trend.
We have a line chart and a we have a so called

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,039
area chart.
So, let's have a look in Excel how we're going

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:28,789
to create that.
We go to the right tab, with the data.

6
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,620
We need the sales trend.
Here we are.

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,820
And we're going to do the same as last time.
We're going to select the data we need.

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,850
This time I don't need my 'ctrl' key that is nagging me.

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,730
I can just select everything I need.
So I have my x-axis data, my actual data,

10
00:00:52,730 --> 00:01:00,670
and my budget data.
And we say 'insert', and we're going to insert

11
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,030
a line chart.
Over here.

12
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,470
2D line.
So, here we have the data.

13
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:14,190
First, we will clean it up a little bit.
Delete the title.

14
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,650
I don't need the legend.
In the last video we will focus on what to

15
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,460
do with a legend.
But we don't need it on every chart.

16
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,340
So we're going to delete it.
For once I will leave the grid lines over

17
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,070
here.
But this line, which is the budget line.

18
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:40,550
And I can see it over here.
I like that to be an area chart.

19
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:50,229
So I select it, I use my right mouse-button,
and I say 'change the series chart type.'

20
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:55,310
And we're going to change that to an area
chart.

21
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:05,770
There we are.
But now it also changed this one.

22
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:19,930
This should still be a line.
Here we are.

23
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,719
I changed it for the two [of them] at the same
time.

24
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,180
This is what we want.
I don't like the colors, so I'm going to change

25
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,219
the color a little bit.
Normally it would be a light blue, but to

26
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,739
make it a little bit easier to see it in the
video I will change it to a color that I don't

27
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:50,379
like but is clearly visible.
And that is.. this one.

28
00:02:50,379 --> 00:03:02,999
And I want to have this in a different number format.
Although, now I think that this is OK.

29
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:06,809
Let's check our master.
Yeah, this is OK.

30
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:11,849
We want that in thousands.
We do have that.

31
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:24,150
Than we just have to change the format to
2.15 by 2.27.

32
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,449
There we are.
I should change the font over here.

33
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:36,019
Otherwise I get text in an angle, and I don't
like that.

34
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:45,400
I will do the same for the vertical axis.
And we should reduce the number of labels

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,900
a little bit over here.
I'm going to format the axis.

36
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,589
We say we want the labels.. make it consistent
with the other one.

37
00:03:54,589 --> 00:04:06,980
We want to have it only [every] three times.
And then we should get rid of any fill and

38
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,870
any border.
We will cut it.

39
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:22,310
Go to the dashboard and I think the sales
trend should go over here.

40
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:32,330
There we are.
And I will call it 'sales trend.'

41
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:39,020
And I will do it here in the chart title.
Sales trend.

42
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,620
And in this case it is really important that
we say something about the number that people

43
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:50,080
see.
It's '1000 x $.'

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:59,300
So, there we are.
So, we're back at our overview.

45
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,800
Three charts are filled now.
Let's have a look what the next video will

46
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,550
bring us.
It's a new type of graph.

47
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,689
It's a thermometer graph.
And it's a little bit different that what

48
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:15,130
we saw until now.
So I will see you in the next video.
