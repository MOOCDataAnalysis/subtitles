00:00:01,689 --> 00:00:08,429
Welcome back everybody!
In the very last bonus video of this series.

2
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:15,159
In the previous bonus video we created a slicer.
And now we can use the slicer to select the

3
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:19,970
period we want, to look at the data.
And the data will change accordingly.

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:26,050
But there is one problem with it.
And the problem is with the top-ten lists.

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,119
Because the top-ten lists are based on a PivotTable.
And we really need that, because we have a

6
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:39,300
lot of customers, so we really need the PivotTable
to summarize for us what are the top-ten customers.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,390
And the same for the products.
But if I change the selection of the period,

8
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,670
then it will look up additional data.
You can see that the trend, the sparklines,

9
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,629
are changed.
But it did not refresh the PivotTable.

10
00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:07,420
To do that I need to go to 'data.'
I should not select a picture.

11
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,690
I should go to 'data.'
And then I say 'refresh all.'

12
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,010
And now on the background it will also automatically
refresh the tables.

13
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:22,720
And we saw some changes over here.
I don't like that.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,250
I would like to automate that.
There is no way to do that with a formula.

15
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,860
But we can do it with VBA.
And it's not that difficult.

16
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:35,380
So, because it's a bonus exercise, we should
try to do that.

17
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:43,590
We need to go into the VBA editor, and we
can do that with key combination 'alt+F11.'

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:55,060
So, here we are in the program environment
of Excel.

19
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:08,530
And here we see our VBA project with our worksheet.
Now, what we want to do is that as soon as

20
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:18,120
this field, this cell, X1, as soon as that
is changed we want that the PivotTables are

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,900
automatically refreshed.
And we can do that by using an 'event.'

22
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,300
And it's an event that should be triggered
by the sheet 'dashboard.'

23
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,590
Where is it..
There we are.

24
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:40,050
So we double-click on it.
Then I say it's a 'worksheet event.'

25
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,780
The first one is always not the one I want.
Because this is a 'selection change.'

26
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,270
Meaning [an] event that will be triggered
as soon as we click (with the mouse) somewhere

27
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,310
on a cell.
But we only want to have an event triggered

28
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:01,099
if a value in a cell in changed.
And therefore we need the 'change' event.

29
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:07,910
Meaning that this one we can delete.
So what we see now is a..

30
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:15,160
We have an event, so every time a cell is
changed on a worksheet, on the worksheet 'dashboard,'

31
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,120
this event is called, and we will get a 'target.'
And the target is the cell, or the range of

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,120
cells that has been changed.
So what we could do is, we could create an

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:42,680
'if' statement.
'If target.Address = "$X$1"', because that

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,250
was our cell.
Then, you should do something.

35
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,260
And an 'If' should always be closed with an
'End If.'

36
00:03:51,880 --> 00:04:00,900
So, every cell can be changed, but only if
it is X1, then the PivotTable should be changed.

37
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:17,960
Now, to do that the PivotTables are located
on a sheet 'CustT10' and 'ProdT10.'

38
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,780
And what will make our life a little bit easier,
if we give the PivotTable that we see over

39
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,310
here a proper name.
So let's do that.

40
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,680
Because normally it is called something like
'PivotTable 1,' but now we're going to say

41
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:42,280
this is the Pivot..
No, I'll just call it 'Top10Cust.'

42
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:53,960
And I'll do the same for the product PivotTable.
With the exception that the name will be a

43
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,280
bit different.
'Top10Prod.'

44
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,330
So now I have two named PivotTables, and that
makes our coding a bit easier.

45
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:10,199
And they're located on the sheets 'CustT10,'
and 'ProdT10.'

46
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:24,900
We go over here and we say we have the sheet
'CustT10.'

47
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,160
And on that sheet we have a collection of
PivotTables.

48
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,750
Or, we at least could have a collection of
PivotTables.

49
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:38,979
And from that collection of PivotTables we
want to have the 'Top10Cust.'

50
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:45,800
And from that specific PivotTable we want
to do a refresh of the table.

51
00:05:45,800 --> 00:06:06,259
And if we have that we can copy it.
And now we have to change it for the 'Prod.'

52
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,900
And this should do it.
So we need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 lines of code,

53
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,910
with the core only being two lines.
Let's check if we did not make any errors.

54
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,380
We did.
And that is correct.

55
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:29,930
It should not be 'Sheet,' but it is a collection
of sheets, so we need an 's' there.

56
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,710
Check again.
Yeah, no trouble, no error messages.

57
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,229
Then I'm always very curious if it works.
So I'll put a break-point over here.

58
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:43,259
So that I'll really see that it will go into
this code.

59
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:55,740
And actually, I should put it over here.
We go to our dashboard.

60
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:03,850
And now I'm going to change to 2016-12.
And, dang, it is in our code.

61
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:20,449
We can see that the address is X1.
And then I have an error over here..

62
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:29,039
I see it.
So we will continue.

63
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,110
And it did work.
So let's remove the break-point.

64
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:44,520
Let's go back and do a final test.
So we're going to change it back to 2016-07.

65
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,560
And now you see the system needs a little bit more
time, but it did not only refresh all the

66
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:57,050
data, but it did also refresh the sparkline
data.

67
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,389
We have a small problem over here, but that's
an error in my own file.

68
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,979
In the file you can download you won't have
that problem.

69
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:11,389
So, that brings us to the end of this exercise.
I hope you enjoyed it.

70
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,860
I hope to see very nice dashboards from all
of you.

71
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,360
Thank you!
