00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,460
Hello everybody!
In our last video we ended with this dashboard.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,599
I promised that we are going to build this
spreadsheet ourselves, this dashboard ourselves,

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,890
in Excel.
But before we start, before you can build

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,570
anything, you have to think a little bit about
how you're going to design it.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,840
So, actually what we need is some kind of
grid.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,700
I can show it to you on the slides, but I
think it would be much better if we switch

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,339
to Excel, and I'm going to show it to you
over there.

8
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:40,199
So here we see our Excel file.
This is the grid, and I'll explain how the

9
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:44,420
grid is working later on.
But before we start I think it is good to

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,890
have a quick look at the file we're working
with.

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,690
And I think one of the first things you see
is that there are a lot of different worksheets.

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:59,149
It would be very cumbersome if we have to
manually navigate through that.

13
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:04,170
So what is a very easy trick: if you go between
these two arrows with your mouse, and you

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,810
right-click, you get a list of all the sheets
that are in there.

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:15,189
And there are two sheets that are very important.
In the first week of this course you learned

16
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:21,770
how to import data from a CSV-file on a regular
basis into your Excel file.

17
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:29,409
That is exactly what we did over here.
This is not a small file, because if I clear

18
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:38,579
the filter we can see that we have about 27000
records.

19
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:46,609
This is a file with financial information,
but we also have a file with sales information.

20
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:53,640
The company that we're working with today
can be described as on online supermarket.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,060
So we can order our groceries online.
And this is the financial data that I get

22
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,939
every month, and here is the data from my
web-shop that gives me exactly which customer

23
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:11,409
has bought which product, in which quantity,
what was the total amount, what was the price,

24
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:15,349
and we made all kinds of formulas that will
look up some additional data.

25
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:20,260
So if I have the 'bell pepper', then I also
know to which shelf this belongs and to which

26
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,239
category it belongs.
And we have these two slides over here.

27
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,010
Here I have my list with products with the
shelf and with the category.

28
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,950
And on this slide I have what is called 'the
chart of accounts'.

29
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:43,299
These are my general ledger accounts, that
are coming from my financial software.

30
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:50,640
I can see all necessary reporting groups.
That are the most important files.

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,959
And then I get all kinds of data, and we will
look into it in more detail later on, that

32
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,610
I need for my dashboard.
But now, let's have a look at the design of

33
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:08,810
the dashboard.
The first thing you have to do is to think

34
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,769
about "what is going to happen with this dashboard?"
Is somebody going to print it out,

35
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:17,420
or is somebody going to look at in from a
screen.

36
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,470
And if they're going to look at a screen,
what kind of screen will it be?

37
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:29,519
Is it an 11 inch, very small, laptop?
Or is it a 27 inch, very large, display?

38
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,060
You should design for the kind of screen or
paper where your dashboard will end up.

39
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,739
And what I like to do if I design a dashboard
is to setup some kind of grid.

40
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:55,829
So I have created little separators over here.
And every box is going to be a graph.

41
00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:02,450
I have reserved one line for a title, for
the dashboard title.

42
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,110
And some general information about the dashboard.
You can see it as the dashboard header.

43
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:19,060
And then I have here an 'area title', a 'chart
title', here my chart can come in, and then

44
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,550
I have a footer for each chart.
And then I will repeat it over here.

45
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,880
Again the 'area title', the 'chart title',
a placeholder for my chart, and a chart footer.

46
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,710
And based on this I can plan my dashboard.
And that is what we're going to do in the

47
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,400
next session.
So here we are, back in our grid.

48
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,810
Let's have a look at our complete dashboard.
In the next video we're going to start working

49
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,819
with the very first graph, the 'sales by category'.
See you then!
