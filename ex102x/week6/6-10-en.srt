Hello everybody!
Welcome back, in this bonus video.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:12,690
Until now, we can change the data on the dashboard
using a dropdown list over here.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,660
So, it's now 2016-12, and we can change it
to 2016-07 for example.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,060
And all the data will be changed.
But we also.. In earlier videos we have looked

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,859
at the use of slicers.
And it would be nice, maybe not for the period,

6
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,110
but it would be a good technique to know,
is how you can use a slicer to change the

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:44,270
selection of the data in your dashboard.
And normally a slicer is linked to a PivotTable,

8
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,220
and a lot of this data is not coming from
a PivotTable.

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:54,100
So we need a little trick to connect the slicer
to our dashboard.

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,510
So let's have a look at how we can do that.
And I have to go to one of my very first slides

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,080
over here.
The 'validation,' because here I have a list

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:13,270
of all my periods.
And what I will do is: I will insert a PivotTable.

13
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:24,229
Oh.. That's not what I wanted.
So we will do that again.

14
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:30,990
Again, we're going to insert a PivotTable.
But I want to have it located on the existing

15
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,079
worksheet.
That's not something I normally do, so I was

16
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:40,659
a little bit too quick with clicking.
I put it over here.

17
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,209
There it is.
It's a very simple pivot table.

18
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:53,289
I will put the period in the rows.
And, I now will right-click here, on the period

19
00:01:53,289 --> 00:02:03,029
field and say 'add a slicer.'
So, now we have a slicer.

20
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:08,819
If I select the value, it's linked to the
PivotTable.

21
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:17,610
In this use case, I'm only interested in one
period that's selected.

22
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,430
That will always be this position in the pivot
table.

23
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,250
So I'm going to give this cell a name.
I will call it 'pivotPeriod.'

24
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:37,150
There we are.
And I will copy the slicer, and let's go to

25
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:44,040
our dashboard.
So here we have our dashboard.

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,950
I will copy our slicer.
And first I'm going to change the formatting

27
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:58,260
of the slicer a little bit.
I want it to have two columns.

28
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:06,430
There we are.
Make it a little bit longer.

29
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,290
That's a bit too long.
There we are.

30
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:21,629
I can make it a bit..
I'm happy with that.

31
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:29,890
Now, over here I say: 'the value in this field
should come from the field pivotPeriod, that

32
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,049
we have just created.'
And that is linked to our PivotTable, and

33
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:41,000
our PivotTable is linked to the slicer.
And now we can choose any period in our slicer,

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,549
and the dashboard will adjust.
So this is a very easy and low-tech way to

35
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:51,670
link a slicer to a specific cell in an Excel
formula.

36
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:57,749
So, that's the first bonus video.
In the next one we still have a little problem.

37
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:05,840
And there we need to dive a little bit, only
two lines, into VBA to get our target there.

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,069
So, I hope that you're very interested now.
And that I'll see you in the next bonus video.
