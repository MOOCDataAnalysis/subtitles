Hi! Welcome to EX102x.
My name is Felienne and I have a nice little

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,150
warmup challenge for you to
get ready for our course.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,280
Imagine you are running a coffee shop.
You are the owner of a wonderful shop and

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,960
you want to do of course... some data analysis.
So I will give you a spreadsheet that looks like this.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,740
It has dates, times, products, and 
the price for which you sell the products.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,060
And you are selling wonderful things
like juices and lattÃ©s and brownies.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,640
And my question for you is:
What is product that was sold best in the last period?

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,940
So of all the data, what is the best-selling product?

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,580
And here is the challenge:

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,220
I want you to do it with as few clicks
and keyboard types as possible.

11
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,000
So please, post your solutions on the forum:
What is the answer?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,060
But also, how many clicks did it take
and how did you obtain the answer?

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,660
Good luck!
