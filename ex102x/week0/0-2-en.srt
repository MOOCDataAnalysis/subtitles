Hello, this is Felienne.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,640
Oh, it was an old version of the data...

00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,760
And I have to do the report again.

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,770
No no, that's not a problem at all.
I can do that.

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,320
Within the hour? Sure sure, no problem.
I will get back to you.

Maybe you can help me do the report again?

00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,260
We will give you a new version of the data...

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,160
and now you can test how robust
the dashboard you made really is.
