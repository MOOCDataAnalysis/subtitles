# Submitting a fix

If you want to submit a fix, ensure that you have [forked](fork.md) our repository first. 
Next create a [new branch](newBranch.md) for your fix.
Now [switch](switchinBranches.md) to this new branch and navigate to the correct file.

Once there, click the edit button:

Make your changes as you would when submitting [new files](existingBranch.md) and 
create a [pull request](pullRequest.md) afterwards.
