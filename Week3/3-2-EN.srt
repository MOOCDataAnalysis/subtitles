1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,500
So pivot tables. In the last video I showed
you that

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:08,200
formulas are really meant for
calculation and not for detailed

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,349
analysis of your data. So we can use

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:15,820
a pivot table for that and pivotting
means turning around. Actually

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,039
I'm not entirely sure why a pivot table
is called that

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,470
I like to think of it more as a flatten
table,

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,680
because what a pivot table does, it
takes a whole bunch of data

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,019
and it flattens it given a certain
dimension.

9
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:36,489
This might sound very cryptic to you
so let's just go to our own data and

10
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:39,540
make a pivot table, so we don't need that

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,989
nasty calculation anymore, we're just
going to select

12
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,379
our entire register log and then

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,010
we're goint to insert a pivot table. So I've
made a worksheet for you, you can select the

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,829
data that you want and then you can say
where you want to have it,

15
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,920
new worksheet is fine but I already made
a pivot table worksheet

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,949
and what's important is that you add this
data to the data model.

17
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,239
I will talk about that later but for now
you just remember that this is

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,830
always what you want. So Excel is now
calculating

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,430
and it has created a pivot table for us.
So maybe you think now what?

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,340
Okay we have a pivot table but I
don't know what to do with it.

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,170
I don't see my data, 
what do I do? I'm a bit confused.

22
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,549
So what you can see here is all the
fields

23
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,189
from our register log are available to
us in the pivot table.

24
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,150
If we go back to the register log we
see that all those column headers

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,400
Excel has detected, has looked at the data
and

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,689
saw that these are the column headers and
placed them

27
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:45,689
in the pivot table for you. So you can pick
one and drag it down to the rows field

28
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,600
and now it's going to calculate some things.
So you see all the beers

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,570
that are in our register log are now in
our pivot table.

30
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,640
And this is in the sense that I mean a 
flattening table, because what happened is

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,590
we had that entire register log: all
these beers,

32
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,080
and what the pivot table has done
is it has flattened into

33
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,150
only the beer names that are here.

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,800
For example

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,380
the Schlafly Oktoberfest occurs twice
but in the flattened pivot table

36
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,750
it only occurs once. Only the unique
values remain.

37
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,410
As you can see here. But we're not really
analyzing yet, now we just have the list

38
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,700
of beers of course we want to do
something with it.

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,430
So what we can do is take that quantity 
and drag it to the value field.

40
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,040
And what happens now is, it is summing the quantity

41
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,410
per beers. So while flattening the
data,

42
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,510
all the quantities that it encounters

43
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,900
are summed and if we sort it we get the
exact same result as we had

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,820
when we were using the SUMIF() function.

45
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,050
We get 170 items sold for the Schlafly
Oktoberfest beer.

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,280
So now again

47
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,630
imagine that our boss comes in and says
what beer

48
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,720
sells best after 11 p.m.? This is super
easy, because we can take the time field

49
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,660
now and use it to filter our data. So we
take time,

50
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,820
we drag it down to the filter and now we
have the list of all times

51
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,830
in a drop-down function. So we just

52
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,780
say we want to select a bunch of them, we
scroll down and we

53
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,810
tick everything that is after 11 p.m. You
could also use a formula for that but

54
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,000
just clicking is also super easy. And
then we 

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,970
see that the best sold beer after 11
p.m. is this Schlafly October.

56
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,120
We knew that from the SUMIF() function,
but now we've done it

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,020
without any formulas! So compare what I
did in this video to what I did in the

58
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,190
previous video.

59
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,370
I didn't use any formulas, it was only

60
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,160
importing my data into the pivot
table, selecting the right fields,

61
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,410
applying the right filter and the
analysis is there.

62
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,900
And it's super easy for me now if I want
to know what's the best sold beer before

63
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,920
7 p.m.

64
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,010
Just changing the filter a little bit, no
formulas needed, no change to any formulas 

65
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,660
needed,

66
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,150
and I have my analysis. So a pivot table
really allows us

67
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,850
to play with our data in easy fashion.
