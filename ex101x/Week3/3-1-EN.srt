00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,500
Hi, welcome to this week's videos! This
week we are

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,020
only going to talk about Pivot Tables
and I'm going to guess that this is a little

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:10,041
bit of a relief to you,

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:13,761
because if you did last week's exercise,
this is probably

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:18,420
more or less what you ended up with. So,
I am going to assume that you have seen

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,600
enough new formulas for a week.

7
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:25,659
So, this week no new formulas, we are
only going to talk about how to analyse

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,540
your data using pivot tables. 

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,200
Also, we are not doing the
hardware store anymore.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
I think we've seen enough of the
hardware store for a little bit,

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,280
so this week

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,420
we are going to be running a bar. The
spreadsheet for the bar is a little bit

13
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,200
similar to the hardware case because we
again have

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,860
an export from a register system, where we
keep track of everything that we sell in the bar.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,017
But we have some more information in this
case, because in addition to the date,

16
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,617
the time, the type of beer that we're
selling, and the quantity,

17
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:57,879
we are also keeping track of who buys the
beers.

18
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,320
So, let's assume all our customers have
some sort of loyalty card,

19
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,068
so we know exactly who buys what at which
time

20
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:07,868
and that of course allows us to do a lot
of nice analysis.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,900
So with this data,

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,960
we also have a list of all the beers that
we are selling in another worksheet,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
all the beers that are there and let's
assume we just Googled

24
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,321
for all the beers and we found a nice
list of all beers.

25
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:24,541
So, of course, a question that we could
ask ourselves is:

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,320
how many of each of the beer types have
we been selling?

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,260
So we can use a COUNTIF function for
that, I am sure this is a pretty

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,000
familiar function by now.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,180
We look in the register log how many
times have we

30
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:39,949
sold this specific beer.

31
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:44,639
Simple, right? You already know that. 
So question: is this formula

32
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:50,219
actually correct? Can you spot anything that
might be wrong with this formula? 

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,120
I'll give you one second to think about it.

34
00:01:55,074 --> 00:02:00,134
So I hope you were yelling at your
computer screen while I was pausing,

35
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,560
because obviously there are few things

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,939
that are wrong with this formula. The
first thing is that beers prefix,

37
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,067
we don't need it. Excel adds it always

38
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:14,187
if you switch worksheets, but it's actually
better to remove it.

39
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:18,500
But something else is wrong with this
function, I don't think COUNTIF is the

40
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,079
right thing to use, because we have a quantity there.

41
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,479
So, what we do with a COUNTIF is just
count

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,940
all the rows that are there, but that's not
what we want.

43
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:32,774
We want to use the SUMIF function,
because we want to have the sum

44
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,580
of all those quantities we are selling.
So we have to change our function

45
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,760
a little bit,

46
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,300
because now we also need to tell Excel
what the column is

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,020
that we are summing, and if we add 
that function, then 

48
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:48,444
the formula is correct.

49
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,020
However, this formula is correct, but something

50
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:57,086
is a little bit inconvenient here,
because you see here in this

51
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:58,640
'Times sold' column

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,032
we only have zeros at this point. Because
the list

53
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:05,034
of all the possible beers that we can sell is so
long

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,320
that the first ones just are not
occurring.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,000
So I have to click Sort, I have to go

56
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:15,029
to the ribbon, click sort, say I want to have

57
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:19,972
only the largest numbers on top. And
then, as you can see,

58
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:24,360
we can see what beers we have exactly
been selling. So it's quite a hassle to

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,140
get everything done.

60
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,000
And in addition to that, we could ask

61
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:33,038
more difficult question. Suppose our boss
comes in and even though we changed our

62
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:37,807
business from a hardware store to a beer
shop we still have the same boss.

63
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:39,280
 Isn't that interesting?

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,340
And she asks very interesting questions
like: what beers

65
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,799
have been most sold after 11 p.m.?

66
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,419
Those are probably interesting to know
because you want to know what beers are

67
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,600
popular early

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,016
in the evening and what beers are more
popular late at night.

69
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:57,059
So suppose we have to add an analysis
like that,

70
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:01,358
it's going to be a little bit cumbersome.
Because, first of all, we have to

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
add another column

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,840
saying what times are after 11.

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,880
And your first intuition might be to use

74
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,040
an IF function there, but it's actually
not needed. You can just use

75
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:13,968
a comparison function

76
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:18,784
as a proper formula in Excel. So, here 
we try

77
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,033
a first attempt, we say if the time is
bigger than 23.

78
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:27,393
However, that's not really working,
because you see here in this case, we

79
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,720
have 11 p.m.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,280
However, we still get FALSE. And the reason
for that is the way that Excel works with

81
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,480
times, is that it saves the time

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,540
as the fraction of the day. So 5 p.m. is
more or less like 0.7 here.

83
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,340
You can see that if you change the time
into a number.

84
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,000
So, for proper comparison with times we
have to compare with a time.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,220
So we have the time, 23 hours, 0 minutes and 0 seconds,

86
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,500
and if we use that as a comparison then
we actually get TRUE here

87
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,819
in the case where the time is above 11.
So I was cheating a little bit. I told

88
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,580
you in the beginning of the video that I
wouldn't show you any new formulas.

89
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,800
This is a new formula, but I hope
you're going to let this one go, because

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,040
it's very simple and it's

91
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,800
only for time comparison.

92
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,259
So, with this function
we can now add our analysis,

93
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,399
because we can

94
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,040
change our 'Times sold' from a SUMIF

95
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:27,459
into a SUMIFS, where we use multiple
conditions to sum on.

96
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,540
We have to change our formula a little bit,
because how the SUMIFS works

97
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,940
is, we get first the column that we are
summing,

98
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,940
and then a list of conditions. So we picked
the quantity column first,

99
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,580
and then we say we want to have the name of 
the beer,

100
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,660
as the first condition. It has to be
equal to the first column of

101
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:47,949
the beers worksheet,

102
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,140
and then the second condition is our
time,

103
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,020
'After 11 p.m.' has to be TRUE. 

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,940
So it's quite a long formula, but it gets 
the job done. However, as you can see here,

105
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,858
the column is now not sorted yet, 
because it is still sorted

106
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:10,013
in the original order. So if you want
to sort it,

107
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:13,533
again, we have to click sort. Here you can
see

108
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,000
those values are not properly sorted yet.
So if we click sort now,

109
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,037
something strange happens. Here you see:

110
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:24,052
Hey, that is not the correct value! The
links

111
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:29,053
again, have been updated and that's
because we forgot this time,

112
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:33,920
I hope you were screaming again at the computer
screen. We forgot to remove that beers

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,909
prefix. So if you remove that,

114
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,119
then we get the correct result. But that
was a lot of work, right?

115
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:45,769
A simple query: what beer is best
sold after 11 p.m.?

116
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,941
We have to add another column, change our
formula

117
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,172
and make sure that we don't forget to
remove the prefixes

118
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,699
and that we don't forget to sort. So what I hope
that you take away from these videos,

119
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,059
is: formulas are meant for calculations. If
you are calculating 

120
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:05,027
a sum or an average, a formula is fine.

121
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:08,787
But as soon as you start to do really
analysis, you are

122
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,421
diving into your data, you're asking
yourself questions like:

123
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:15,083
what's the most popular beer on a
Saturday

124
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:19,012
if the temperature is below zero degrees?
Something like that.

125
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:23,992
If you're analyzing your data formulas
quickly go out of hand. And I think you

126
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,460
saw in this example that

127
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:30,005
that just happens very quickly. So 
remember: formulas are not for analysis

128
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:33,405
and of course then, what is for analysis?

129
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,597
Pivot tables! More about pivot tables in
the next few videos.
