00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,350
Hi, welcome back! I can imagine that the
last video left you a little bit

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,350
confused, because

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,599
I was doing some magic here, just
clicking fields together and suddenly

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,719
everything worked.

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,980
Maybe you were screaming at your computer
screen again, like what's going on

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,600
here?

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,580
So in this video we're really going to
look at what

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,040
exactly happened there.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,680
So, we're not going to work with
adding a new pivot table anymore.

10
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,810
Actually, secretly, you didn't know that,
but secretly

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,410
we were working with Power-Pivot. So
let's go to the PowerPivot worksheet and

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,760
manage our data.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,440
And what you see here, is that PowerPivot
has stored all that

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,180
data for us. The data that we have
added to the data model, it's

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,460
a little bit tricky, actually it should
have said

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,160
'add this data to a PowerPivot model' 
because PowerPivot is storing that data for us,

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,940
and here you see the data in a diagram
view. And if I click that link,

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,350
you see that this is the link that I
have actually created

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,330
when I was clicking. I said: this is
related to that,

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,030
the beer is related to the name. So let's improve
those names a little bit, because 'Range'

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,940
and 'Range1' aren't good names. Let's
rename them to 'Register' and 'Beer'

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,520
so they align with what is in our
spreadsheet model.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,320
So now we have a view of our data, this
allows us to do some more cool analysis.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,390
For instance,

25
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,920
we would like to know: what countries do
the beers that are popular in our bar

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,760
stem from?

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,070
So do we drink US beers? Do we drink

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,640
German beers? Dutch beers, maybe? We want
to know that.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,130
But in order to do that, we need to have
some more information.

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,920
We need to go to the brewery worksheet,
because the brewery worksheet has the

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,170
information of what

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,100
brewery is in what country. So we are not
going to make another pivot table, we

33
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,960
don't need to do that to add it to the
data model.

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,100
You know that we were secretly working
with PowerPivot, so we can say now

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,159
I want to

36
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,650
go to the PowerPivot ribbon and add

37
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,170
the data to the data model directly. So
you see here

38
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,410
we get all the data in a similar way
that we got it before,

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,300
all the column headers are right there.
We can immediately rename it to

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,060
'Breweries'

41
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,780
and now we can create a relation. We
don't need to go to the

42
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,959
pivot table where Excel says: Ha,

43
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,760
I need a relation, and then we create it.
We create it directly.

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,060
We can say the brewery name in the beer
worksheet is related to the name

45
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,810
column in the brewery worksheet. And
when we make that relation,

46
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,760
we can use that to build our pivot
tables on. So if you go to a pivot table

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,720
now, you see that, in addition to the
register and the beers,

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,830
we also have a list of breweries. And we
can use that

49
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,849
to make our country analysis, we can
drag country in

50
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,000
and then we get the number of beers that
we have sold

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,709
for each of the countries. So what happens
in the background is: this

52
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,630
country is linked to the beers through the
brewery name and those beers are linked to

53
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,800
the beer list, to the register log

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,470
in the beer name. So PowerPivot traverses
all

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,720
those relations

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,660
secretly in the background, makes something
like a VLOOKUP

57
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,220
to haul all the data in and then you can build
a pivot table

58
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,709
right on top of that. We don't need to do the
actual VLOOKUPs,

59
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,270
if we add everything to the data
model and create the relations

60
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,170
we can build a pivot table on top of that.

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,680
So let's look at the data again,

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,349
what is the traversal that we go through?
We go from the register log

63
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:42,440
via the name through the brewery, from the
brewery name through brewery

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,760
and then through the country. So that's the
exact same traversal

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,140
that I did, but now I did it in the data
instead of in the data model.

66
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,870
So that leaves us with this pivot
table

67
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,470
in which we can see what are the beers that
we have sold

68
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,210
for each of the countries.
