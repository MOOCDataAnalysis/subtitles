1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,250
So in the previous videos, we looked at how
to use pivot tables for simple 

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,080
analysis

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,099
and in the following videos we are going to

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,809
really dive into all the possibilities
that pivot tables have to offer. So this

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:13,820
is what we ended up with

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,130
in the previous video. So what we could do
now is

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,039
add another row field, for instance add
the date, and now we get a

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,350
stacked list of rows. So we get

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,570
the type of beer and, underneath it, all the 
dates

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,920
on which we have sold the beers.
We can open and close them like a folder

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,579
structure

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,309
and we can investigate exactly at what
date have we sold which beer.

13
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,329
And we can swap them too, so we can make
dates the highest level,

14
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,660
and then we get for each day what are
the beers we have sold

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,989
at that date. And that makes it easy
again

16
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,180
to really dive into the data and understand
what are my customers doing,

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,740
when are they drinking what type of
drinks? 

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
So, so far we've only 

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,260
looked at SUMs, but we can use all types
of different functions there, we don't

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,380
need to use SUM.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,369
There's a lot of other function that we
can use if we go to the value settings

22
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:12,979
below.

23
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,979
If we click them... 

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,860
Yes, there we go. If you click them, you 
can select a lot of other fields.

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,299
So you see SUM, but I can also use 
COUNT or MIN or MAX.

26
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,509
So let's pick AVERAGE, let's pick the
average amount

27
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,360
of quantity that has been sold. And what
does that exactly mean,

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,970
the average amount of quantity? It's not the
average of the entire column,

29
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,369
what we get is the average per beer of
whatever is in that quantity column.

30
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,979
So, you can see that if we sort the values, let's
sort them,

31
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:52,380
so we can really see what's going on. Yes,
there we go, we sort values and we see that some

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,229
beers 

33
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:57,930
are on average sold in a quantity of two.
So we can say that the Chocolate Stout

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,610
is really a date beer, people buy it in duos.
Whereas a Bud Light is

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,630
usually bought in bigger groups.

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,070
And that sort of makes sense I guess, you buy 
a couple of Bud Lights for your friends, but a

37
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,050
Chocolate Stout,

38
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,070
you might buy that for your date. 
So when using an

39
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,170
average we look at the data in an
entirely different way. We are not looking

40
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,210
at the total

41
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,990
but while flattening the data 
we are taking the average

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,600
for each type of beer that we sell. So in
this way pivot tables allow us

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,860
to really dive, again I'm going to say
this multiple times in this series,

44
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,980
dive into the data and help us understand

45
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,160
what it actually means.
