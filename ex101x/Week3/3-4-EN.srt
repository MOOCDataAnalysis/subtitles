00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,980
Hi, welcome back! In previous videos we've
looked at

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,040
pivot tables extensively, and in the previous
video

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,380
we looked at how to use different
functions: like an AVERAGE function

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,500
instead of a SUM.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,740
And there's one more function that I'd
really like to talk about and this

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,430
is called the Distinct Count.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,730
So it's different from a COUNTIF or a
normal COUNT function, where you just

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,100
count the number of lines. This distinct count

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,830
counts the number of different customers,
in this case,

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,460
that have bought a specific beer. So if
you use a distinct count, you can see

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,749
what beer is popular with a lot of
different people.

12
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:41,859
And that's really a different measure
from a COUNT and in the exercises

13
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,420
we will talk about this distinct count
a little bit more, so this is why I

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,440
wanted to show it to you.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,100
But there's one thing in the whole
pivot table view

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,670
that we haven't really looked at yet,
and that's this 'Columns', right here.

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,459
So we filtered, we have used different
functions, different values,

18
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:01,869
but we haven't added columns to the mix.
And columns in a pivot table

19
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:05,709
literally add another dimension to your
data analysis.

20
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:09,800
Because, in previous videos, we've only
looked at this row dimension

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,940
and now we're also going to add columns
in our pivot table.

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,370
So let's have a look at how that goes. We
don't need the guest ID

23
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,580
and the count anymore.
What we are going to add

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,250
as rows is all the different times and
what we're going to add

25
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,000
as the calculation is

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,350
the count of the quantity.
So what we see now,

27
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,700
per time of the day: how many quantities
have we sold?

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,410
And then we drag in columns. So we add
the guest IDs

29
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,600
as columns. Let's zoom out a little bit so
we can

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,600
better see what happens. So what we see now
is an overview of

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,950
per customer at the time of the day what

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,890
is actually being sold. So you can see
this first customer right here,

33
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,979
he is a regular. He buys beers at 5 p.m.,
at 7 p.m.

34
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:04,260
Whereas the second customers is different,
he either buys before dinner

35
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,099
or after dinner. And the third customer
again is different, because he only comes in

36
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,389
late at night. And by analysing your data
in this way you really

37
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:17,069
get an overview of what exactly
happened, what times,

38
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,099
what customers are doing what?
So this is not really

39
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,780
meant for having an overview
analysis, it is meant for really diving into

40
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,549
your data. So you can exactly see

41
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,779
who is buying what at what time.
So let's add another example of

42
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:35,590
using columns, so instead of using
guest IDs we're now going to use

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,739
beer IDs

44
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,879
but we're keeping time as rows. So now
we come profile beers.

45
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,260
We see that this first beer right here,
is really a beer

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,010
for early in the evening, where our
second beer is a beer

47
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,260
that's been sold late at night more. So
by

48
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,499
adding columns to your pivot table
you're not summarizing anymore,

49
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:59,900
it's more like profiling what exactly
happens in our data.

50
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,109
And this, again, allows you to really gain
a more detailed understanding

51
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,989
of what is happening in your data.
