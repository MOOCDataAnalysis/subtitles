00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,169
So I'm sure you've got it by now that
this week's

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:08,460
videos are all about pivot tables. But
what we have done so far is we've only

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,740
looked at the analysis

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,210
of one worksheet. We've only dug
into

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,240
this register log, but there's more

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,609
in our spreadsheet, right? We have the
list of beers. In addition to the times

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,699
and the quantities, we also have
different beers and

8
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:29,010
they are related in a sense to the beers
in our beer list and we have more

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,970
information there.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,380
Because we can we have a brewery here, we
know the type of the beer, we know

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,149
alcohol percentage, so we would like to
analyze that. For instance,

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,600
what is the alcohol percentage of our most
sold beer or something like that.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,140
But we can't do that now, because we don't
have that information in our pivot table.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,379
We only have the information of the
register log. So this video is all

15
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:57,160
about how to combine multiple worksheets together
into

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,660
an overview pivot table. 

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,000
What we could do of
course,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,010
maybe you were yelling this again to
your computer screen,

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,659
is we could use a VLOOKUP. So if you
want to have the brewery associated with

20
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:11,369
each beer,

21
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,909
we can just use a VLOOKUP. We set, of
course, the final parameter to FALSE, you

22
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:17,960
know that by now,

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,820
and then we have the brewery for each
beer. And now we could do an analysis

24
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,200
on the breweries. However, if we would
continue this

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,950
we haul in the brewery but we also
haul in 

26
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,290
the alcohol percentage, and the type, 
and the category of beer,

27
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,020
we get a lot of duplication. Basically
we're going to repeat the entire beers

28
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,799
worksheet

29
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,619
in the register log worksheet. What I hope
you take away from this course is that

30
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:46,149
you should really be aware

31
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,340
of duplication. If you are doing the same
thing

32
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,759
a lot of times, probably you are not doing
things in the easiest way.

33
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,840
Because I'm sure there is always a way to do
things once,

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,079
and to repeat the analysis from there. So I
hope,

35
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,630
maybe in a year or two and you're
working on your spreadsheet

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,429
and you think: "Hey, I've done this before,
an hour ago".

37
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,039
I hope you remember me:

38
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,450
Duplication is not a good idea,
there should be an easier way

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,549
to do this. I'm going to present that easier way
to you in this video.

40
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:24,310
So I promised you all the way back,
like three videos ago, that this

41
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,629
'adding things to the data model' is
really important and I'm going to come back

42
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,040
to that promise right now. So we've added
this data

43
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,120
to the data model, it is stored somewhere.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,379
If we're going to do the same thing with
our beers,

45
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,889
we're making a pivot table of the
beer list

46
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,370
and, again, we're adding this data to the
data model,

47
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,389
we're putting it in another worksheet.
I've made a worksheet called BeersPivot,

48
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:54,049
and this is where we place the pivot
table for the beer list.

49
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,780
So what you see here now, exactly as we
saw

50
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,180
in the previous pivot table, we have all
the fields from our worksheet there,

51
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,659
we can do nice analysis on it like

52
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:09,599
the brewery, what is the number of
different beers from this brewery?

53
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,139
We can sort and then we can see this
first brewery,

54
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,699
the Midnight Sun Brewing Company, has 51
different beers.

55
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,079
But what we're actually calculating now

56
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,440
is the number of beers in the beer list,

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,760
in this worksheet there's no relation
yet

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,590
to the beers that we in our bar are
actually selling.

59
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,620
This is not the beers we're counting,

60
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,599
we're counting the beers from the beer list. So

61
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,329
now here's where the data model comes in.
If we go to all data

62
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,979
and we see that in addition to the data
from this worksheet that we are analysing

63
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,040
right now,

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,250
also the information from the register
log is there,

65
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,040
and this is because we have previously
added this data

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,470
to the data model. We can use the same data

67
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,959
from the first pivot table in our second
pivot table,

68
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,579
because we previously added this to the data
model that's what matters here.

69
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,579
So now we can change our analysis we can
say: Hey,

70
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,959
we don't want to have the number of
beers from

71
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,289
the beer list. No, we want to have the
number of beers from the register.

72
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:22,150
That's the field that we want to add.
Let's take that field,

73
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,380
throw this away,

74
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,150
and we drag in the number of beers.
Now something interesting happens.

75
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,810
Excel says: Hey, I don't know how to do
this.

76
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,350
These two things aren't related. Basically
what Excel is asking us is:

77
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,560
I don't know that VLOOKUP, that VLOOKUP
that we manually made in the beginning.

78
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,100
Excel doesn't know how to handle it, so
we have to tell him

79
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,330
what the exact relation between those
two fields is.

80
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,990
And you can see here how we do that, the
things we were coupling in the VLOOKUP

81
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,520
we couple them together again. And if we do
that now,

82
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,760
we sort our data, then we can see what

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,930
brewery sells the most popular beer in
our actual bar.

84
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,650
So we've made that connection between
those two worksheets by

85
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,090
adding both of them to the data model
and then telling Excel

86
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,070
the beer field in our register log is
related to the name field

87
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,630
in our beer list and then we can make an
analysis based on

88
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,200
two different worksheets. All with pivot
tables!
