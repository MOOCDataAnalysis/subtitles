1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,970
So we've talked about spreadsheets a lot
the past couple of weeks,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,290
so isn't it time we talk about the
elephant in the room:

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,360
Problems with spreadsheets, because you
must have encountered them

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,880
in the exercises or maybe in your
daily job with spreadsheets

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,000
you run into problems with spreadsheets.
And it's not so surprising if you remember

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,769
the numbers from the first week that
95%

7
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:30,240
of all companies still use spreadsheets
and that 50% of

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,210
spreadsheets are used in decision
making and then of course is not so

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,520
surprising

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
that problems arise. And you remember maybe
also

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,850
that spreadsheets have a very long
life-span: 5 years on average,

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,430
during which they are used by 12
different people.

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,250
And most spreadsheets do not have proper
documentation.

14
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,449
So there's actually no way if you
think about it that

15
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,059
this would go right. If it's so
important for companies

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,600
and many people are involved, things are
bound to get

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,880
wrong. And they just do.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,380
There even is a European Spreadsheet Risk

19
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,890
Interest Group (EUSPRIG.org) that
keeps a list of spreadsheet horror

20
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,070
stories.

21
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,979
It's quite funny, if you have some time
after the exercises of this week's,

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,329
I recommend you go there and have a look
at

23
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,450
a lot of companies and organizations
that

24
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,150
run into some kind of trouble from
very small to very large problems

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,740
because of spreadsheets. And I've compiled
the most fun

26
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,220
3 spreadsheet horror stories. Here's one that

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,450
I really like,

28
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,970
the London Olympics in 2012.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,930
So you would expect the London Olympics,
like the biggest event of the year with

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,219
a gazillion pounds in budget,

31
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:52,320
to have a very sophisticated ticketing
system.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,900
They don't, they use spreadsheets to keep
track of

33
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:58,390
the tickets they've sold. And they made a
tiny

34
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,350
mistake in one of their spreadsheets

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,469
and this ended up in one of the stadiums
being

36
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:06,939
overbooked by 10,000 tickets. So it's not
really

37
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,899
money lost but it was of course very

38
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,250
embarrassing. People had to come into the
ticket

39
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,760
office to exchange their tickets for
another day...

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,260
So it is a really nice example of a spreadsheet
horror story.

41
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,190
Here's another one. A university in the
US lost 2.4 million

42
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,250
dollars, because of a spreadsheet problem
and

43
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,910
here's another one: a Canadian power company

44
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,550
lost 24 million dollars, because of a
copy-paste error in a spreadsheet.

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,960
So of course it is very easy to blame
spreadsheets, you could say

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,980
spreadsheets are just bad and this is
why we have mistakes. But that's really

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,660
not fair, this is not a typical spreadsheet
problem.

48
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,680
If you look at other domains, for instance
programming.

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,170
Programming has very similar error rates

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,910
to spreadsheet development. About one to five
percent

51
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,060
of all lines of code or all formulas
have an error

52
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,110
and the same goes for other cognitive
design

53
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,700
activities like creative writing.

54
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,600
Also, if you're writing, you tend to make
tiny mistakes.

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,780
Just human brains aren't better then a
1 to 5 percent

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,300
error ratio and this is understandable.
And if you look at

57
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,060
problems in programming, very very
similar type of

58
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,960
horror stories exist, very recent horror
stories

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,610
in the programming domain. You have
healthcare.gov, there were

60
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,700
recently a few

61
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,340
very big bugs like 'heartbleed' and the 'goto fail'

62
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,500
So you can't really blame spreadsheet
for being problematic, because

63
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,620
other types of programming really run
into very very similar problems.

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,530
So why is that?

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,980
Like everything, spreadsheets and software
products start small.

66
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,060
They start with small little cute
puppies, you can

67
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,140
easily manage them, because they're still
young and simple.

68
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,160
Same goes with spreadsheets: you start off, one worksheet,

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,570
a bunch of formulas, looks very cute,
nothing is problematic.

70
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,100
However, they all grow up to be this guy, right? 

71
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,120
If you don't train your dog and
if you don't

72
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,930
manage your spreadsheet or manage your software,
everything will go wrong.

73
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,950
So that's exactly what this week's videos

74
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,630
are about. We will talk about how to
manage your spreadsheet and make sure

75
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,540
that it grows up into a responsible dog

76
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,180
and not a couch-shredding monster.
