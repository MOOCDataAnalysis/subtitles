1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,470
So, in previous videos I've talked about
how to test your spreadsheet

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:08,189
using Excel, using formulas. And that's
fine, that's a very good way to do it,

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,490
it's way better to have Excel formulas
test your spreadsheet

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,129
than nothing at all, so keep doing it!
But in this video I want to talk about

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,000
a tool that we have developed here, at
TU Delft, at the Spreadsheet Lab,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,090
to help you test your spreadsheet even
easier.

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,710
The tool is called Expector, that's what
this video is about -

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,180
test your spreadsheet with Expector. So,
here's Excel how it normally looks,

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,469
only we have enabled the Expector
plug-in, so

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,840
in the ribbon you see there is the
Expector option now,

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,900
and that's how it looks if you install
the plug-in as well. What we can do with

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,879
Expector is

13
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,239
help our tests. So we don't need this

14
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,309
extra worksheet anymore for all the
overall testing,

15
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,280
because that's exactly what Expector
is going to do for us.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,530
So we delete it, we can also delete these
overall tests, they're really not

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,730
necessary

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,379
anymore, because Expector
is going to gather all spreadsheet cells for us.

19
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,010
So how does it work? If you enable

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,979
Expector and you say: "I want to extract
all the tests", you go here,

21
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,880
you say Initialize. What Expector is
going to do is: it's going to

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,610
run through all the formulas of your
spreadsheet, and it's going to look

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,270
what looks like a test formula and you
get a list here.

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,259
So, for example, you see here that G4 is
the test formula and it tests whether

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,060
C4 is lower than 0. Expector knows
that and adds

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,210
all of those tests to this list of tests.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,369
And if you save them, you get an 

28
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,299
additional worksheet in which all of the
tests are located. So we hit "Save",

29
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:52,380
let's do that. Yes, there it is! So now we
have an additional worksheet

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,990
in which all of the detected
cells are listed.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,270
So, it extracts the test, only the part of the
formula that's testing,

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,049
and it shows you where the test comes
from and what

33
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,200
the part is, that is being tested. So, in
this case

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,069
the C4 is lower than 0, that's exactly
the part that is extracted

35
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,260
into the new

36
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,860
worksheet. So, what Expector also does is: 
it adds links - you see the blue guys

37
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,560
over here.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,610
Those are the links to the original
location of the formula. So, if you

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,540
click the link,

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,010
Excel takes you to the original location.

41
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,090
So, we don't remove the test cells, we
just add another worksheet,

42
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,620
but you can still use your original
tests, and even navigate there

43
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,760
from the Expector worksheet. 

44
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,600
So, with these tests you can now

45
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:47,810
run them - you can hit Run in Expector,
and you get an overview of all the tests,

46
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,500
and it shows you which cells are failing

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,220
and which cells are passing. So, the ones below 
are failing,

48
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,480
those are the ones where something is up.
So, you don't have to add an additional

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,769
formula to look

50
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:04,139
for the erroneous value anymore, you can
just scroll here,

51
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,980
you say "Hey, this value is false". You hit
the link and Expector directly

52
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,700
takes you to wherever your spreadsheet
is failing, it makes it easier

53
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,260
to understand what's going wrong. So you
see here,

54
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,389
click the link and is easy to see where

55
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:24,500
exactly the problem is located, because
we know the test, we know what should

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,650
hold, what should

57
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,919
pass and what should fail, so we can
just for

58
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,269
failing tests click the link and we are
taken to the formula.

59
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,780
One more thing that Expector can

60
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,790
do is to add colors to the test - if you
don't like the long list, maybe you're

61
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,730
more of a visual person, you can hit

62
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,139
"Color Tests", and as you see here, all the 
correct cells are marked in green,

63
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,879
and all the erroneous cells are marked in red.
And this just comes

64
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,699
over conditional formatting. So suppose
you already have conditional formatting

65
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,859
or even a regular formatting in your
spreadsheet. With Expector we just

66
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,419
put an overlay on top of it, so there's no
confusion anymore

67
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,290
between what really means a green cell
and a red cell,

68
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,930
because the cells you see now are
only based on passing

69
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,870
and failing test formulas.

70
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,460
So what can Expector also do is: it can help
you understand which parts of your

71
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,359
spreadsheet

72
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,090
are already tested - if you click the

73
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,160
Highlight Tested Cells button, everything
that is currently

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,010
involved in the test is marked yellow. So
you see - this is a test cell

75
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,260
and then, because that cell is linked to
another cell,

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,290
we say that cell is tested as well. So in
this

77
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,260
sense everything that is tested,
from the test cell

78
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,260
right to input, is marked yellow, so you
can easily see which parts of my

79
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,060
spreadsheet

80
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,240
still need my testing attention.
Let's do the same exercise for another

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,490
worksheet - if we hit

82
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,820
Highlight Tested Cells here, we see that
this cell here,

83
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,930
well, it's a very complicated lookup
function,

84
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,419
there's no test yet that makes sure that
those names of the products

85
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:11,680
are actually correct. And that's a weak
spot in our spreadsheet, where we have a

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,130
complicated formula,

87
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:18,030
however nothing is yet being tested. So
that's the Expector tool,

88
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,690
it helps you find the tests, and helps
you run

89
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,120
all the tests and quickly see what is
passing and

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,080
what is failing, without manual effort in
locating the tests,

91
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,770
and also helps you to understand how
well your spreadsheet is already being

92
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,560
tested

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,860
by highlighting what is tested and what
is not yet tested.

94
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,950
So that's spreadsheet testing with
Expector,

95
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,990
we'll add a link on edX for
you to download Expector and to play

96
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,650
with it yourself, if you want to.
