1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,029
So, I'm sure you're now convinced you
have to test your spreadsheet in order

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:04,940
to avoid

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,470
horrible problems. But then, of course, a
question is:

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:12,590
What to test if we look at a spreadsheet,
where to start

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,279
and what are those typical situations,
typical formulas, that could go wrong?

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,289
Let's have another look at our Hardware
example.

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:24,519
If we look at this example, if you
download it from the edX

8
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,260
website, then you can have a look with me
at what could

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,420
exactly go wrong. For example, if you look
at this 'Margin' formula, what do we

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,000
know about a margin?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,379
Are there specific rules that hold for
margins?

12
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:42,160
Well, if you think about it a little bit,
probably

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,780
this margin should be bigger than
zero. Probably

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,550
we don't want to sell things for a lower price
than we have bought them for.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,649
There are some businesses that do that,
maybe you have a super,

16
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,539
super special promotion, but I'm just
going to guess: for normal company

17
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:03,180
the rule is: your margin has to be above
zero.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,760
So you try it! Download spreadsheet from
the edX website and have a look at

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,540
what are typical testings. This is not

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,479
an exercise that you have to fill out, I
just hope you're going to keep a list

21
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:20,650
on a piece of paper, and then, in this
video,

22
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,189
maybe I will talk about some of the tests
that you had also

23
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:29,520
thought about. So let's look at this
margin. You could say that this margin,

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,640
the fact that it has to be above zero,

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,090
is some sort of a "sanity check" - does my
spreadsheet make sense?

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,619
And these are common, this type of "sanity
checks". You have knowledge about your

27
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,759
business domain

28
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,840
and you know what typical rules should
hold.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,399
And those rules help and those roles are
exactly what you want to test.

30
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,180
So, what else could we test? If we look at
this percentage here,

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,490
that's another thing where, if you see a
percentage you think:

32
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,409
"Hey, I know something about a percentage!
Probably the percentage should be

33
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,719
between 0 and 100 percent, because that's
how percentages work!"

34
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,149
So, if you see something like that,
immediately your "Test",

35
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,000
your "Test sense" should go off in the back
of your head,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,980
and you think "Ha, a percentage! I know something
about that! I know what boundaries

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,220
hold for a percentage!" And that's another
type

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,780
of checking your data. If you see a
specific value,

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,560
you think about: what are logical
boundaries. For

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,500
currencies often 0 is a logical boundary,

41
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,020
because you don't want to sell less than
zero, or if you're,

42
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,370
as we do here, you're counting a number
of items,

43
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,959
0 might also be a good boundary because
we don't want to sell,

44
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,310
we can't sell less than 0 items. Can you
think of more?

45
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,260
Are there other tests on your list, on
your sheet of paper where you were

46
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,980
taking notes? Do you have others? Here's
another one that you could try.

47
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,630
The SUM of those percentages that
we're calculating here

48
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,730
should be a hundred percent, because we
divide all our profit

49
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,610
over different items that we're
selling so if we group all of them

50
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,480
together,

51
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,130
it should add up to 100 percent, or
something is wrong with our formulas

52
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,570
or input! And this is what we call a
"totals check".

53
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,180
We add everything together and then the
total should be

54
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,400
a hundred percent. That's usually a "totals
check".

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,500
Or, the total should be equal to whatever
we are selling

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,959
And there is something more we can do in
this example

57
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
in addition to the "totals check". What we
can do

58
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,150
is calculate the totals in a different
way.

59
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,430
What we can do is: sum the values here,
but we also sum

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,450
all the turnovers together, and that
should also be a hundred percent.

61
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,120
So now we calculate our values in a
different way and we see here

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,040
that we also get a 100 percent, and
this is called a "cross-check",

63
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,329
where we calculate the same result in
two ways.

64
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:04,610
And then if we make a mistake in one of
them as you see here,

65
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,910
we immediately see that those values
don't add up any more -

66
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,160
one of them is 100 percent and the other
is not.

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,010
This is called a "cross-check" and this is
very common in financial statements,

68
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,030
where you calculate your values in
this direction

69
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,500
and in this direction and then

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,780
you make sure, in the end, they
actually calculate the same thing.

71
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,810
So these are a bunch of ways that you
can test your spreadsheet:

72
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,410
"sanity checks", "boundary checks" and "total
checks".
