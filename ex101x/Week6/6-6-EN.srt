1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,299
So, in the previous video I showed you how
to add test formulas to your spreadsheet

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,639
and also how to add overall tests that
combine the input

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,029
of those tests together. However, there is a
downside to this - if you look at

4
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:17,000
spreadsheet,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,640
let me show it to you, you see an
error here.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,470
What do you have to do? You have to go up... Oh,
there's an error in the margin.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,490
You have to scroll to the tests, you have
to scroll down.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,570
"Oh, what row is the error on? Oh,
it's there"

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,579
And then you have to trace all the steps
to see what actually goes wrong.

10
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,230
So, in case of an error, there is a lot of
work you have to do

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,480
to pinpoint the exact location of the
error.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,770
So, what can you do? Let me show you an easy
trick

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,039
to more quickly pinpoint where errors are.

14
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,489
What you can do is add another column to
your overall test set.

15
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,770
Let me zoom out a bit, so we have some
more room.

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,420
We add an additional column where we are
going to

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,500
detect the location of the failing test.

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,460
We can use the good old MATCH function
for that, I hope you remember it from

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,200
all the way back in like the second week
of videos. We can use that to detect

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,299
what the line of the error is. So we add a
MATCH

21
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,759
and we are looking for the value "Error".
So in the first one

22
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,259
there is no error so we simply get #N/A,

23
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:25,409
Not Available (error). No problem, we're only
interested in

24
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,460
this result for the situations where there
actually

25
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,659
is an error. So if we add a MATCH there
and you see that the result

26
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,860
of the MATCH function is the row on
which we have the error,

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,030
row 9 - that's actually where the mistake
is.

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,250
So, if you add a MATCH function like this, you
don't have to search

29
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,200
manually for the erroneous lines, you get
the result with the MATCH function,

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,960
and you can see:

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,850
"Hey, line 9 is the line with an error". And this is
especially useful if you have like

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,560
hundreds of lines,

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,640
then you want to know on what line error is.
You don't want to scroll there

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,340
and maybe you also don't want to use a Filter 
for the erroneous lines, you just want

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,460
to quickly locate it.

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,060
So, let's design our spreadsheet a bit
better,

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,680
we add a border around all the test
formulas, so that it's really clear for

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,450
whoever is going to use this spreadsheet

39
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,500
after us that this is a special part of
the spreadsheet.

40
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,209
And what I like to do is then - add a link

41
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,390
to the final test formula

42
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,819
on top of my worksheet. So I say this is
"are all checks okay"

43
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,430
my overall check and I just link to

44
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,610
the error formula downstairs. So then I
can see

45
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,209
immediately if I open the worksheet, is
everything okay?

46
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,060
Yes or No? And maybe I don't always have
my test block

47
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,320
on the downside of my spreadsheet - if I have
a very long worksheet maybe I place my

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,930
check box

49
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,880
somewhere to the left of my formulas, or
somewhere to the right,

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,300
wherever there's a logical place in my
worksheet. So it's a very good idea

51
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,680
to link to the first line of your
worksheet - if something is wrong,

52
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,200
you can see it immediately if you open
it. And I

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,600
can repeat this trick for all of the
other worksheets as well.

54
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,190
Let me zoom in again, and then go to the other
worksheets.

55
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,320
In other worksheets we had some test
formulas as well,

56
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,400
so if I add this test formula in all of
the worksheets

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,470
on cell B1, on the first line it's very
easy for whoever is going to use a

58
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,070
spreadsheet

59
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,370
to immediately see "Huh, is everything
okay?".

60
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,690
And what I can do then if I have
installed all of these tests on all of the

61
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,360
worksheets,

62
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,700
is add an "All Checks" worksheet in which

63
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm going to combine all those tests for
all the worksheets

64
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,489
in one overall testing worksheet.

65
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,299
So I can use the INDIRECT function here,
you remember that from the previous

66
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:50,920
lecture,

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,489
where I can input a string, a text, and
it will evaluate the results. So

68
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:58,859
as a string I use the name of the
worksheet and B1,

69
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,019
and then for all the worksheets I
immediately

70
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,620
get the results without any additional
formulas. And then, of course,

71
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,560
there's only one thing I can still do
and I'm sure you have guessed

72
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,459
what my next move will be, is add one more
test formula on top of those tests.

73
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,859
Again I'm going to count the number 
of OKs

74
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,090
and compare the number of OKs with the
total number

75
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,689
of lines, of rows, in my worksheet, and if
there are the same

76
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,889
it's OK, and if not everything is OK

77
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,659
there is an error in my spreadsheet. So I've
added tests

78
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,439
everywhere in my spreadsheet, I gather
all of them together

79
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,740
and one value on one worksheet,

80
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,909
the one check, the one

81
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,509
test to rule them all, this test
tells me is

82
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,729
everything in my spreadsheet as I

83
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:55,669
expect it to be. And in this way, if I
send my spreadsheet to another

84
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:56,560
department,

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,360
another colleague, another company, maybe
a customer,

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,610
if they mess something up, either in the
formulas or in the input values,

87
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,039
and I get my spreadsheet back, I just
simply have to go

88
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,389
to my one check formula and then I can
see is

89
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:15,069
everything okay, is everything still as I
expect it to be,

90
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:19,009
or is maybe something wrong. And that's
a very good way

91
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:20,549
to keep your spreadsheet safe!
