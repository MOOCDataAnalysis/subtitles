1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,910
So in the previous video we talked about
how to test your formulas,

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,000
how to make sure that the results they
deliver are within reasonable boundaries,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,120
for example,

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,910
but there's another way we can test.
What's also very important in

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,009
spreadsheet testing

6
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:19,210
is validating user input. If you look at
this spreadsheet,

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,150
this 'Selling Price' right here, it's an
input value.

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,710
A user puts in that input and he could
make a mistake.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,240
And we want to let the user know as
early as possible

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,320
that he has made a mistake. For instance,
if we enter new item here,

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,180
the 'Stone Table',

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,489
if I make a mistake and I accidentally
input a negative number,

13
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:43,800
then, suppose we would have a check on
the percentages,

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,270
we would know, because we see now that
percentage is off the chart, so

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,230
that cannot be correct. But there are
more subtle ways in which we could make

16
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,030
a mistake. Maybe we entered the same
number twice,

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,160
and then this percentage is zero, which
might be okay, that might still be

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,710
within the boundaries. So what we want to
have is

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,220
for fields, for cells, where spreadsheet
users

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,580
add their input, have some validation
rules

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,860
right on top of that. Here is another
example of validating user input.

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,159
If we look at this register import,
we see

23
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,450
all the codes of the items that we
have been selling,

24
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,030
and this formula, the 'Category' formula,

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,340
it just chops off the first item, the
first character of

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,780
the text and puts it in a list. So
suppose

27
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,310
we add a pivot table on top of that data,
calculating

28
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,079
the profit per category, we need to be
sure that that category is actually

29
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,430
an existing category,

30
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,479
that is actually in our list of
categories, and we have another worksheet

31
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,229
where we keep track of the categories. We
would want the user to know

32
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:57,040
if faulty input is provided, a code is given
with no associated category,

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,790
we would like the user to have an
error. And a lot more validation

34
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,920
is possible in this input worksheet - I'm
not going to tell you how, because this

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,969
is one of this week's

36
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:11,300
exercises. So you can start thinking
about it right now!

37
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,060
How would you validate the user input in
this spreadsheet?

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,600
What's important about

39
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,470
tests is, you remember from the previous
video, that spreadsheets only one in three

40
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,930
have a manual.

41
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,840
And you might think: what does
documentation

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,060
have to do with testing? Those are two
entirely different topics.

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,940
That's really not true! Tests

44
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,380
can serve as means of documentation.

45
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,680
If you put a test in your spreadsheet

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,350
the test tells a user of the spreadsheet
something

47
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,030
about it. If I look at this formula here,
so I have added a formula that checks

48
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,250
whether a given item has an existing
category and if it doesn't,

49
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,850
here you have a code that starts with an X,

50
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,370
if there is no associated category, you
get an error.

51
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,790
So this test tells a story, this test
expresses

52
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,900
to the user that only existing
categories

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,410
can be input. Otherwise, something is
wrong.

54
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,090
So in this way you can use tests to
communicate

55
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,510
information about your input to your
future self,

56
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,000
if you still work with the
spreadsheet in five years, or maybe one

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,670
of the 11 other people that are using a
spreadsheet.

58
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,459
So tests are means of documentation,

59
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,459
in addition to, of course, their purpose
as

60
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,319
actually checking for errors.
