00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,830
So, how to manage your spreadsheet? That
is the central question

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,340
of this week's video - how to make sure
that that cute little spreadsheet puppy is

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,880
not going to turn into

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,349
this huge monster, that everything remains
clear and calm

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:19,150
and error-free. So in order for us to dive
into

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,630
how to manage a spreadsheet, we're going to
look again at the hardware store.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,130
I hope you remember this example where
we export data from a register

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,949
and analyse our sales in a spreadsheet.
So, here's a recap

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,950
of the data that is in this spreadsheet - we
have

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,780
a list of items that we're selling, we
have their names, their selling and

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,160
purchasing price,

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,340
the margin, which is the difference
between the purchasing and the selling

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,010
price,

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,030
and the same margin expressed in
percentage.

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,840
So this is really a very small spreadsheet,

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,070
there's hardly anything that could go
wrong with such a small example.

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,250
So in this sense, it is really useful as a
running example, because it's really like the

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,640
puppy.

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,580
It's super small, so if we make sure that
while it's still small

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,420
it behaves well, it might grow up to be
a responsible

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,820
spreadsheet. So, remember also from

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,390
the second week's videos that if you
use a link,

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,400
for example, in a spreadsheet, a direct
link to another worksheet,

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,740
if you start sorting the links,
everything gets messed up.

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,700
So this is a typical risk in a
spreadsheet and our solution so far was

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,740
just to make sure

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,710
that we use right formulas. We know
how to build the formulas, and we know

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,900
that if we use an INDEX-MATCH
function

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,100
then nothing goes wrong; that even if
you sort the other part of your

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,509
spreadsheet then

31
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:47,320
still you get the right results. However,
remember that

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,659
many things in your spreadsheet can
go wrong.

33
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,220
This is just one example, there are so
many things

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,560
that could potentially go wrong - maybe
you input the wrong

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,659
value, maybe you used the wrong formula,
maybe you miss copy-paste and you 

36
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:03,649
copy-paste your data

37
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:08,280
in a wrong part of the spreadsheet... And it's not
just you, you're not the only one working

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,120
with the spreadsheet - in a typical
situation

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,090
12 different people are

40
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,180
working with one spreadsheet. So maybe
you know what to do after you follow

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,920
this MOOC,

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,830
but does everyone else involved in your
office in the spreadsheet?

43
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,830
If you send your spreadsheet to someone
from Sales, will they also know what

44
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,790
formulas to use?

45
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,319
So everything in this week's videos is
about how to keep our spreadsheet safe,

46
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,420
how to keep that spreadsheet safe and
keep the

47
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,500
bad influences out. Wrong inputs,
wrong formulas,

48
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,680
how are we going to protect
ourselves from those bad inputs?

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,640
And remember, other disciplines have very
similar problems,

50
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,069
like programming, but also hardware
design, if you build a car,

51
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:58,970
this car is not going to go on the
highway before it has been extensively

52
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,280
stress-tested. We do this type of
things with cars

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,010
before we even allow someone to drive in
them. Other domains use testing

54
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,299
to make sure that whatever they build is
really

55
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:15,269
well-structured, and that is exactly the
approach that we're going to take in

56
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,410
this week's video -

57
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,000
we're going to stress-test our
spreadsheet and make sure

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,480
that nothing can go wrong!
