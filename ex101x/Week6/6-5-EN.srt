1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,150
So you know about testing, you know why
you should test and

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,700
you know what to test, but we didn't
address yet

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,710
how to test, how are we going to express
to the user of the

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,130
spreadsheet that a test is broken.
Well, there are

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,810
two different ways that you can test in
a given spreadsheet, as you see here.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,439
The first thing you can use is conditional
formatting.

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,880
Maybe you've used it before - conditional
formatting is a feature in Excel

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,510
where you can change the colour or format
of a cell

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,969
based on specific rules. Here you see how
it works.

10
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:39,030
So suppose you want to add conditional
formatting on the 'Margin' column.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,100
We select the entire column and then we
select

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,789
Conditional Formatting. We get a pop-up
screen,

13
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:49,309
and in the screen we can select, there
we go,

14
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,770
we can select, we want to have a rule
for values that are below

15
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,140
a certain threshold. And then we can say
below what threshold should it be,

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,270
and we say if it's below 0 we want to
have it become red,

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,369
and then you see it becomes red for all
the values below zero.

18
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:11,260
And it immediately works for the entire
column because we selected the entire

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,060
column when we added the rule. So if we add
another

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,070
new item to our catalogue and we make a
mistake,

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,580
we immediately get the red value in

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,299
the cell. Conditional formatting is nice.

23
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,540
It works really well because, as you can
see, the erroneous values, they really

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,780
hit the eye. They attract your attention
because they're really different

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,380
from the other values. However, this is not my
preferred way of testing.

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,770
First of all, some colours can have a
different meaning - you can use

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,659
conditional formatting, for instance,

28
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,960
as we do here where, where the red values do
not

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,310
indicate an error - what they indicate here
is

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,009
the percentage is below 10 percent. And
that just means

31
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,469
the item isn't selling very well, only
less than

32
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,860
10 percent of the profit is coming
from this item.

33
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,469
So that doesn't mean there's a mistake
in my formulas, that means that I

34
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,090
should do a good review of my product
catalogue

35
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,569
to make a decision am I still going to
sell this item.

36
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,320
So sometimes,

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,200
the colours red don't indicate wrong
values, but they indicate

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,670
problematic values - a product or an
account that just isn't selling so well.

39
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,820
That's one reason why you don't want to
use conditional formatting,

40
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,870
and another reason is that if you do it
in a different way,

41
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,750
as I'm going to show you, you can build
formulas on top

42
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,240
of the test formulas. So let me show you
how

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,110
I prefer to do it. No more conditional
formatting, so we're going to clear

44
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,360
all the conditional formatting rules and
what we're going to do is

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,410
add a test formula. So, in another column,
we say

46
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,680
"is the margin OK?" and there we add a
formula that expresses

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,790
what we expect from the values. So we say:

48
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,940
"Hey, if this value is below zero", we say

49
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,420
"error, this is too low!" and otherwise
it's okay.

50
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,660
And if we drag the formula down, you see
that those erroneous

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,000
values get a notification "Error, too low!".

52
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,620
And if you do it like this

53
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,800
you can build formulas on top of it,

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
as I said before. You can use this value
because it's just another cell

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,820
value, you can use it as the input for
another formula.

56
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,140
And this might sound a little bit
cryptic, so let me show you

57
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,610
what I exactly mean with that. So what we can
do here

58
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,830
is add an overall test formula where
we're going to check

59
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,270
is there an error in the list of our

60
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,320
checks. So what we do is we count, we use
a COUNTIF,

61
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,860
and we count the number of OKs in

62
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,690
the whole margin column. And from the
number of OKs we subtract

63
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,760
the general number, with the
COUNTA,

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,370
the number of all items in the list. And
now we see

65
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,870
that this is not 0, it is -2, which means

66
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,310
we don't have the same number of OKs
as the total number of values

67
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,380
that we have. That means not everything is OK, so

68
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,730
there is an error. 

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,040
We can add that we don't want -2 as the value, we want again

70
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,020
to make this into a test formula, so
we say: if it's -2

71
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,060
then it's an error. If it's any value 
below 0,

72
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,230
then there's an error and otherwise

73
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,740
it's OK. So now we've build a test 
formula on

74
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,560
top of all the test formulas that we
already had. And we can repeat this

75
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,290
process,

76
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,930
we can add a number of columns next to it,
and say for all of the columns

77
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,680
add another test formula. And we can
repeat this trick

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,340
at the higher level where those four
column tests,

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,370
again we're going to combine them into
one test

80
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,120
where we count the number of OKs, and the
number of OKs

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,280
should be equal to the number

82
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,070
of items, test cells in our list.

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,310
So now we can have one big test at the
end of the

84
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,190
worksheet, where all the test columns and
all the overall tests come together.

85
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,100
And then this is a formula again where we
want to add conditional formatting,

86
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,990
because in this error there's no way this can
mean anything else. If a cell that says

87
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,170
Error is red,

88
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,910
probably something is up there. There's no other
meaning that this could have. So for such a

89
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,170
final test formula, adding conditional
formatting

90
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,790
is a really good idea!
