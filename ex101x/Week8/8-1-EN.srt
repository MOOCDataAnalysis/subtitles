Last week, we worked on calculating
Bacon numbers

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,780
and we did that both in Excel and in Python.
And what I hope you took away from last

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,900
week's videos and also from last week's
exercises,

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,960
is that the tool you use influences

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,169
what solution you can come up with. If
you're working in Excel then typically

6
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:20,029
you think

7
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,589
in terms of cells and references between
cells.

8
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,359
And if you have to work with lists in
Excel, you have to

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,710
use array formulas and it's possible,

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,010
but it's harder and this limits the way
you can think.

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,690
Whereas, if you solved the same problem in
Python,

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,429
it gets a lot easier, because lists are

13
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:44,100
first class citizens. You can just take
any range in the spreadsheet

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,120
and put it into a list immediately and
if you want to do some sort of operation

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,329
on your list, like a minimum, you just
have to use

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,409
MIN and the list that you want to work
on. You don't have to fiddle with

17
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:57,800
array formulas.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,569
So because you're using Python, it's

19
00:01:00,569 --> 00:01:04,239
easier to work with lists, because they
are built-in in Python

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,199
and you don't have to go through a lot
of trouble.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,380
And exactly this idea holds in many cases, so
if you use

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,890
the wrong tool for the job, then

23
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,040
it's not only less efficient to hammer
a screw in,

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,340
it is not just that. It gets harder and
also limits your

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,299
imagination. If you always build stuff
with a hammer,

26
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,890
then probably you're never going to come
up with the dovetail connection,

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,969
because this is a connection where you
connect wood without using any nails,

28
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:39,369
so you don't need the hammer. And if
you're always grabbing for the hammer

29
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:40,189
first

30
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,369
you will never come up with this solution.
And this exact same idea holds in data problems,

31
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,750
if you always sit down at your
spreadsheet immediately,

32
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,009
there are some sort of solutions that
you're just never going to come up with,

33
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,229
because they don't fit in the
spreadsheet paradigm and that's what

34
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,249
this week's videos are all about!
