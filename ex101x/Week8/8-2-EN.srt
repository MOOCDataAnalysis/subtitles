1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,000
Maybe we were using the wrong tool all
along,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,670
so let me show you another tool to use,
using

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,809
a fresh new example. What you see here
is a map

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:15,949
of the Netherlands. This is where we are,
we are in Delft.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,769
Suppose I want to take the train

6
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:22,599
from Delft to Groningen, that's here.

7
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:26,000
So there's no direct train and we can
see this on the map,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,160
because the trains are the black lines
on the map

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,329
and there's no direct train from Delft
to Groningen.

10
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,270
So how am I going to make this travel? 
I have two different options:

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,820
either I take the train to Leiden,
that's here,

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,020
or I take the train to Rotterdam, that's
there,

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,730
and from there I can take a direct train

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,510
to Groningen, so either I go this way or

15
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,710
I go that way. And if I want to calculate
what the best

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,830
option is, I also need to add weights to my
arrows.

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,370
So this one from Delft to Leiden will take
me

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,040
21 minutes, from Delft to Rotterdam,

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,080
will take me 12. And then from

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,430
Rotterdam to Groningen is two hours and

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,830
39 minutes and this one

22
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,100
is two hours and 28 minutes. So I can
calculate

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,210
my total travel time by summing these
two

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,370
and summing those two and for this
representation

25
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,500
I don't even need the map anymore. If
I have my graph,

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,580
my lines and my nodes with all the
numbers attached,

27
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:41,580
I can just delete the whole map.
There we go!

28
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,240
And this is now a correct representation
of my problem.

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,659
I have a node Leiden, Rotterdam, Delft

30
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,380
and Groningen, and I have arrows
between them,

31
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,490
this one, that one and those two and
those arrows.

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,979
have weights. And this is called a graph,
a representation of the problem

33
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,510
in terms of nodes and arrows.

34
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,920
And of course, you have imagined that we
can use this same

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,430
scenario, the same method, to analyse our
Bacon problem.

36
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,379
Let's have a look at the Bacon problem,
how it looks like in a spreadsheet.

37
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,409
We have actors and movies and actors

38
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,920
that have played in movies, and I can
draw this problem

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,430
like a graph too, like I did it with the map
of the Netherlands.

40
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,389
I can say here's Kevin Bacon and he has
played

41
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,900
in the movie 'Crazy Stupid Love', I just
draw a line

42
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,359
between the actor and the movie. And I can
repeat this,

43
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:39,579
I can add Emma Stone and Julianne Moore

44
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:44,340
because they have played in 'Crazy Stupid
Love' too. And I can continue this process

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,790
and make an entire graph of the problem
that we are analyzing:

46
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,319
Who has played in which movie? And
because we're representing it like a

47
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,219
graph,

48
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,379
you see that, immediately, your view on
the problem changes,

49
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,700
because it gets really easy now to
calculate the

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,019
Bacon distance from Bacon to
another actor, because we can just

51
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:04,939
traverse

52
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:08,340
the lines in the graph and that's what
we're going to explore

53
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,269
in the next video.
