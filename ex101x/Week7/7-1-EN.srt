00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,380
In previous videos, we've talked about
problems with spreadsheets and how to

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,559
address them with testing.

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,220
But spreadsheets just aren't always the
right solutions -

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,090
there are problems that you can come up
with in your

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,990
work that are just not solvable with a
spreadsheet.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,349
And those are the types of problems that
we're going to talk about today -

7
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:26,249
when not to use a spreadsheet. So over
the past few weeks you've learned a lot

8
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:26,869
about me

9
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,999
and the things I like, like teaching and crafts
beer,

10
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:33,789
but there is one of my hobbies that we
haven't talked about, and that's going to

11
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:37,800
the movies. I really like the movies!
I even have a subscription

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,250
to the movie theater in my city that I can
go to all movies

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,079
unlimited. So this week's exercises will be
all about

14
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,399
a little movie database I've made in a
spreadsheet, where we have movies,

15
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,429
the studios that made the movies, the
rating of the movie, so when you can see it,

16
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,620
the year that the movie has been
released in, and

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,679
the type of movie, the genre, so the
action, adventure... And we have

18
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,580
a lot of data.

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,620
In addition to the movies in our
database we also have actors

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,580
and movies that they have played in. So,
here you can see that Andre 3000

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,400
has played

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,280
in a Volcano movie. So it is a nice
little database for movie information

23
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,180
that we can analyse. So there are a lot

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,960
of analyses we can do on this data.
For instance, we can analyse the

25
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,250
studios that actors have worked for.

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,640
We could be interested in the question:
"what actor in our database

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,720
has worked for the most different, the
the highest number of different studios?"

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,730
So we can get the information in
from a studio with a VLOOKUP,

29
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,560
this should all be easy for you if
you've watched all of the videos.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,700
So we add a VLOOKUP, and we get the
information of

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,560
every studio associated with a movie.
And then we can select

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,660
all of that data, there it is, we can select
all of this data

33
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,820
and add it to a pivot table. This
should also

34
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,420
be a piece of cake if you've watched
all videos. So,

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,030
we add our data to the data model,
because we're going to want to use a

36
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,880
Distinct Count

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,140
to calculate the different
number of studios

38
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,280
that people have worked for. So, here's
our pivot table,

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,760
we drag in the name of the actor, there it
is,

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
and then we drag in the studio,

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,780
and we get the number of studios that people
have

42
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,120
worked for. And there's one little

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,310
thing that we still need to change, it's:

44
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,890
we need to go to pivot table
properties and we say "we don't want to

45
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,140
have the count,

46
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,670
but we want to scroll down, we want to
have the Distinct Count".

47
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,280
And if this is done calculating... Takes
a while...

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,340
Now we can sort and then we can see that
Christopher Lee has worked for the

49
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,810
highest number of different studios, I
think it's 42.

50
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,270
Yes, there it is! It's 42!

51
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,880
So, we have a lot of data in our database
and we can analyse it in different ways,

52
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,319
using VLOOKUP and using pivot table,
we know that by now.

53
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,340
But let's try to ask ourself a different
question:

54
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,270
we would like to know for all of the actors
not the number of studios that they have

55
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,970
worked for, but we'd like to know for
every actor

56
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,400
their Bacon number. I thought Bacon number
was like a very familiar concept,

57
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,850
I did the same exercise in my class, here
in Delft, for 40 students,

58
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,270
and I said: who knows what a Bacon number
is? And, like

59
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,599
two hands went up... So apparently, it's a
little bit of a movie-geek thing, so I'll

60
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,319
explain to you what it is.

61
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,590
An actor's Bacon number is the number of
steps that an

62
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,650
actor is removed from Kevin Bacon. So
Kevin Bacon himself has Bacon number 1,

63
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,740
and someone that has played in a movie
with him, for instance,

64
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:47,150
Ed Harris in Apollo 13, he will
have Bacon number 2.

65
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,430
Someone that has played in a movie with Ed
Harris,

66
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,250
like Nicolas Cage in one of my favourite
movies, The Rock,

67
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,250
will have Bacon number 3, because his
distance to Kevin Bacon

68
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,790
is 2 hops via Ed Harris. So in this way
we can chart everyone who has played in

69
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,770
movies

70
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,239
based on their distance to Kevin Bacon. So
the number of hops, the number of steps

71
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,430
from Kevin Bacon

72
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,650
defines the Bacon number. We should be
able to calculate this information in

73
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,590
our little movie database, right? Because
we

74
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,180
have the information -

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,289
we know who has played in what movie,
but

76
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,629
how to get this

77
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:28,029
out? How are we going to process the
information in such a way that we get a

78
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,120
nice little list

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,499
of each actor with their Bacon number?

80
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:36,219
So I challenge you before you watch the
rest of the videos

81
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:39,990
to try this. And don't try it on this huge
database,

82
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,870
but try it on this little database. We
will put this online,

83
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,650
in the course website, it's just easier
to play with such a little spreadsheet

84
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,539
than with an entire list of

85
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:55,729
thousands and thousands of actors. So,
please don't watch the next video yet,

86
00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:00,580
download this, play with it, and try to
see if you can come up with a way

87
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,060
to analyse the Bacon number for each
actor. Good luck!
