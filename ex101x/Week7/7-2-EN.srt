1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,080
So we are calculating the Bacon number of

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,190
bunch of different actors in our
spreadsheet. And

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,080
to stay on topic, I want to say: big spoiler
alert!

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,830
If you watch the rest of this movie, you
know how to do it. So if you still want to

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,550
try it,

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,140
this is your second chance - stop
watching this now,

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,240
download the spreadsheet and try to see if
you can do it for yourself!

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,100
It will really be a lot more fun than
watching me just explain it.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,050
Okay, you're still here,

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,179
I guess you've done your homework, so
let's see how I solved this problem

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,980
using a spreadsheet. Here's our database,
or

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,270
our spreadsheet,

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,440
the little version where we just have
a number of actors. So the first thing

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
that we need,

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,600
of course, is to determine who in our
spreadsheet is actually

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,129
Bacon. Well, that's pretty easy, we can
just use a conditional formula

17
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,309
where we say: is this actor equal to
Kevin Bacon?

18
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,280
If it is, he will have the Bacon number 1,
if he isn't,

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,899
we could say: then you have Bacon
number 0, but that's not

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,939
entirely accurate. Actually, the Bacon number
of someone

21
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:08,649
in step 1, who is not Kevin Bacon, is not
0,

22
00:01:08,649 --> 00:01:10,229
but it's undefined.

23
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,189
There's no way of connecting two
actors. So we

24
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:16,359
use a little "-" (dash) for that, instead
of 0,

25
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,159
which is mathematically just more

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,789
accurate,

27
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:22,200
and it would also help us because
in the rest of the solution we're going to

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,009
use mathematical functions

29
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,119
like the SUM and a MIN and if we have 0

30
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,289
in there, it might mess things up. So,

31
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:33,289
in one step the only one we can reach

32
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:36,719
is Kevin Bacon, so he has Bacon number 1,

33
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,079
and the rest we don't know yet. So, based
on this, we can see how far we can go.

34
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,359
Let's go back to our list of movies
and it's pretty easy to determine now

35
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,020
which of the movies have someone in
them with a Bacon number that's not

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,459
undefined. We can just do a VLOOKUP of
the list of actors,

37
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,759
there we go.

38
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,329
Of course we use FALSE,
because we're using a direct connection.

39
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,319
Don't forget: select this and hit F4,

40
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,420
and then we can drag this formula down,
and the movies that have Kevin Bacon

41
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,860
in them will now have a 1 after them. For
instance, Crazy Stupid Love

42
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,280
has Kevin Bacon in it, so it gets 1. So,
what we would like to do now is

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,370
propagate this 1

44
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,730
to the entire movie, so we can see who

45
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,019
else in the movie will get the Bacon
number 2,

46
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:32,290
because Kevin Bacon is in it. And what
we like to have

47
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,079
in the movie worksheet is a Bacon number
not of an actor,

48
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,829
but of a movie. And we can of course do
that again, with a VLOOKUP,

49
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:44,069
if we look here, we can see who is in the
movie.

50
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,540
And we use a little bit of a dirty trick
for this, because we can use

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,810
the SUMIF

52
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,129
function. We just sum all the values

53
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,819
for a given movie and we sum the steps
that we currently have. And if we sum

54
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,760
a 1 and two dashes ("-"), the result
will be 1,

55
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,260
and if we sum just a bunch of dashes
the result will be 0.

56
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,590
So this SUMIF will actually result

57
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,569
in 1 if someone in the movie has a Bacon
number,

58
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,739
and will result in 0 if no one in

59
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,379
the movie is connected to Kevin Bacon.
So if we drag this down,

60
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,230
you see those two movies, Crazy Stupid
Love

61
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,109
and Wild Things, have 1 and the
other movies have 0.

62
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,579
So we are slowly getting there

63
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,829
because we know now in one step
what actor,

64
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,230
Kevin Bacon, and what movies can I reach,

65
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,470
so we can continue this in the second
step.

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,220
So now we want to have the correct number,

67
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,439
not just for the Kevin Bacon version of
the movie, but for all of the other

68
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,439
actors in the movie. We can do this again
with a VLOOKUP -

69
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,219
we're going to go to the movie worksheet,
VLOOKUP,

70
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,980
and we find the associated Bacon number

71
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,209
for the movie, and we can hit F4

72
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,430
and then we can drag this down. So we are
close, but here we have zeroes,

73
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,680
because the VLOOKUP

74
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,819
in the other worksheet, the SUMIF
resulted in a 0, and that's not what we

75
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,880
want - we want to have a dash.

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,970
So let's see, if this VLOOKUP is equal
to a dash,

77
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,340
then the result should be

78
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,830
another dash. Oh, I'm sorry, if

79
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,890
it is equal to a 0, it should be another dash,
and otherwise it should be equal to the

80
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,540
VLOOKUP but plus 1, because Kevin Bacon's

81
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,580
Bacon number is 1 and everyone who has
been in a movie with him

82
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,220
should get the number plus 1. So now
we have the right numbers

83
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,470
in the right line for all the actors, and
if we just

84
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,020
get this in in the actor worksheet, we will
have the correct calculation.

85
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,699
So there we go, Step 2. What we can
just do

86
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:59,139
is use another VLOOKUP and we're
going to look for the

87
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:04,520
actor and now we take that fourth column,
the D column, because there we have -

88
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,520
everyone who has been in a movie with
Kevin Bacon will have 2,

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,740
and the others will have a dash. So
this is

90
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,500
almost correct, we see that those

91
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,759
people that have 2 are indeed

92
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,770
the ones who have been in a movie with
Kevin Bacon.

93
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,870
So, it almost works. There's just one thing
that's still a little bit strange, is that

94
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,360
in the second step Kevin Bacon now has 2,

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,160
and that's because we went from him

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,800
to Crazy Stupid Love and back, but that's
not really fair,

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,289
because he already had the Bacon number 1.
So what we really need to do is -

98
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,569
take the minimum

99
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:45,400
of what we have already calculated and
what is in this

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,190
extra step. And you see that in the
previous video I forgot to hit

101
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,560
F4 there, so I've corrected that now as well.
So we see Kevin Bacon now has 1,

102
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,860
all the others have 2, but unfortunately,
because of the use of the

103
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,889
MIN operation, we now get an error
value (#VALUE!).

104
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,280
I don't know why this is, but if you have
2 MINs, if there are in

105
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,509
different worksheets, apparently Excel
gives an error. So we add

106
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,789
IFERROR around it, if we get an error
then we

107
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,960
write a dash, and otherwise we use the
MIN.

108
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,960
So, we have done it - now, for one step,
we've calculated:

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,940
1 - Kevin Bacon, and everyone that has
been in a movie with Kevin Bacon now has

110
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,270
Bacon number 2.

111
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,210
We would still need to continue this
entire step

112
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,389
another time if we would want to do it for
three steps and

113
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,710
for four steps and for five steps.

114
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,629
So, can we do this? Yes, we can! You've
just seen me do it.

115
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,889
However, if you continue this calculation,
and I encourage you to try to continue it

116
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,340
by yourself,

117
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,180
then you'll see that for three steps you
will need

118
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,199
8 auxiliary columns, 8 conditional formulas,
3 MINs and

119
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,099
8 VLOOKUPs. So that's maybe not
really what you want

120
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,909
and then you're just at three steps. And I've
looked it up, and apparently the highest

121
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:04,439
number that

122
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,370
an actor in Hollywood has is 12, so if you
want to continue this calculation for

123
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,169
12 steps,

124
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:12,889
then we need like 25 VLOOKUPs.

125
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,930
So, probably we're not really on the right
path here,

126
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,150
but it is possible.
