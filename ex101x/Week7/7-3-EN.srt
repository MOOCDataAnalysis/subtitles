1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,350
So we've calculated the Bacon number in
the previous video

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,660
in Excel which is possible but takes us a
lot.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,660
I'm not afraid to admit that it took me
about five hours to come up with this

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,620
solution, and I am quite handy with Excel,

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,289
so this is not a solution you want. Actually,
I hope that

6
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:26,039
in your mind you have something like
this: WIIIIEEEEE, The No Excel alarm!

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,420
If, in your daily life, you're making a
solution

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,350
that takes you more and 10 VLOOKUPs
to put together,

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,820
then something is off. You should
really be thinking:

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,649
am I using the right tool for the job,

11
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,660
is this still the best way to do it? So
of course then the question arises -

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,559
what should we use? What is a better tool
to use

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,680
then a spreadsheet? What about
programming?

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,120
Isn't it easier if you use a programming
language, because with programming you

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,550
are not limited to

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,140
the rows and columns of Excel, you can
do anything you want.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,500
This might be a good solution for a
problem where Excel is not entirely fit.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,080
However, I'm a little bit like a Hobbit,

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,550
I like to stay in my comfortable Shire,
I don't want to leave my

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,110
comfortable Excel home, to go to a
programming language that

21
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,070
I'm not familiar with. Of course we could
use VB.

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,850
Visual Basic for Applications is a
programming language that is embedded

23
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,380
right in Excel, maybe you've been working
with it before,

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,040
and this you can use as a programming
language to

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,310
automate your spreadsheets, to
calculate things

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,590
that you cannot do with a formula. This is
a

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,160
possibility, if you have been working

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,380
with VBA before,

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,820
I challenge you again to try to solve
the Bacon puzzle

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,920
with VBA, this should be a lot easier

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,570
than using formulas. However, that's not
what we are going to use in this course.

32
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,900
What we are going to use to automate
our spreadsheet is a language called

33
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,180
Python. So, why Python? One of the reasons
that I like to use Python is

34
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,850
that it's currently the number one
programming language

35
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,410
taught at universities. So in a few years

36
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,330
there'll be lots of people around the
world that really know how to program

37
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,710
in Python.

38
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,130
It's also quite easy to learn, you'll see
that in

39
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,270
examples in this video, that the syntax,
the way you write in programming language,

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,300
is quite easy, and also there's a big
ecosystem around Python, that means a lot

41
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,630
of

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,940
small Python programs, called libraries,
exist in the world

43
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,140
to solve problems, and if you have such a
problem

44
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,910
you don't need to write in the Python yourself,
you can just use the programs

45
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,280
other people have already created. So
these are all reasons

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,370
that I prefer Python over VBA, but VBA
is also a good programming language that

47
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,530
you can certainly use for this type of
problems.

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,460
But, if I want to use Python,

49
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,520
do I have to go away from my spreadsheet
home? You can.

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,470
You can use Python totally separate from Excel,
but then you have to do a lot of learning,

51
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,340
you have to migrate your data from a
spreadsheet probably to a text file, so...

52
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,490
I don't want that, I want to have
Python and Excel,

53
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,520
both of them. Luckily, there is a solution.

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,100
There is a cool program that's called DataNitro
that allows you to use Python

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,860
in Excel. Much like VBA, you can just
script your spreadsheet with Python.

56
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,560
This solution unfortunately is only
available for Windows,

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,060
but there are alternatives for Mac and for
Linux, we'll put links to the alternatives

58
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,069
on the course page. So let's try to use

59
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,290
DataNitro, here you can see it, if
you had a keen eye

60
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,150
you've seen that in the screenshots
of one of the previous videos

61
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,400
there was a DataNitro plugin. So,
it's right there in Excel,

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,420
and if you go there, if you go to the
worksheet, let's click it,

63
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,790
if you click Python Shell, you get something
like a calculator where you

64
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,209
can type formulas, like 3 + 5,

65
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:08,250
much like you can type formulas in Excel,
but you can also refer to

66
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,160
the spreadsheet. You can do something
like C2 + 5,

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,959
but you don't do C2 as you do it in
Excel, you have to directly call

68
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,389
the value. So you see,

69
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,910
say, give me the cell on C2, the value,

70
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,090
and add 5 to it. And it's not just
reading,

71
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,570
you can also

72
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,950
write to the spreadsheet, as you see me
do here. Let's put "Hello!"

73
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,870
in A1 and then you see that not just
A1 has changed,

74
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,600
but also all the values that depend on
it. So you change a value and then

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,540
the spreadsheet calculation kicks in,
and everything is recalculated.

76
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,220
But let's quickly put it back to Kevin Bacon
because, otherwise, our nice

77
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,060
Bacon calculator is messed up.

78
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,870
So this seems to be a good solution that
might help us

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,470
to solve our Bacon problem with Python,
and that's what we're going to do

80
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,690
in the next video.
