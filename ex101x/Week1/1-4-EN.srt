1
00:00:00,081 --> 00:00:03,781
This is where we left off in the previous
video, we used

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:05,339
 the LEFT and FIND functions

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,959
to chop off that part of data that
we need in order for us to be able

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:13,082
to use the value in calculations. And in
the meantime,

5
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:18,000
you, in the exercises, have also added
this Trend column,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,027
where you chop off the first part of the
Change column.

7
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:25,820
And I'm not going to show you the formula,
so if you haven't done the exercises yet

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,679
you still have an opportunity to do so.
What I've also done in the meantime is: I've

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,025
added not just the value,

10
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:35,005
the number of shares I have, for the
first row,

11
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:40,460
but also for all of the others. So I've just
gone back to this first worksheet

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,580
and copied all the data in. And as I said
in the previous video - yes, I will explain

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,900
you a better way

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,040
to connect two worksheets together. If
you already know it, don't worry, this is

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,420
not how I think it's done,

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,680
but for this exercise it's just easier to
copy the data in.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,880
So this is typically the point, if you
have a lot of columns,

18
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:04,463
where you're going to want to clean up
your worksheet.

19
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,119
If it doesn't fit on the screen anymore,
it's time to do some organization.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,439
So let's scroll back to the first columns
and these

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,779
first 5 columns, they have a special
role, right?

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,000
They are imported from the web. So we can
indicate that to future users of the

23
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:21,004
worksheet by

24
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:24,072
adding a column here, a border on the side

25
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:28,272
of the column. And here are two other
columns that play a different role,

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,560
because they are built

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,380
on the web data and then I have two
more columns. And

28
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,034
if I've done this, I don't really need
the original values anymore,

29
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:41,374
because with my String operation I have
retrieved the information that I need,

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,340
and I can still refresh the data even
though the columns are hidden,

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,760
the calculation is still refreshed after
I hit the Refresh button.

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,119
So this already looks a lot nicer, now
in one

33
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,259
view you can see what's going on. Only
the final column is bothering me a

34
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,420
little bit,

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,020
because some of the values have 2 and
others have 1 decimal.

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,000
So what we can do here, in this cell
formatting

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,019
pop-up that you bring up by hitting
Ctrl + 1,

38
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,039
we can set the number of decimals. But we
can go further than

39
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:14,700
that, we can even indicate that the
value is a currency

40
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,800
and add the Euro symbol before it. So
it's a lot more clear for someone who's

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,014
going to work with this spreadsheet,

42
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:24,019
and you remember from the first video
that there are probably

43
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,043
12 people over the next 5 years.
It's a lot clearer for them

44
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:31,340
what this value means, because they
can see

45
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,320
this is money that we're talking about.

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,720
So, organize your spreadsheet well - if
you have people over to your house,

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,980
you're going to clean your house. If
people are going to look at your

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,220
spreadsheet, you organize your worksheet.

49
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,820
And in the spreadsheet that you're going
to send in for the homework,

50
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,980
we are going to look at your
spreadsheet or you are going to

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,000
 peer review

52
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:56,960
other people's spreadsheets and this is one
of the things that we will be paying

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
attention to

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,440
in those reviews.
