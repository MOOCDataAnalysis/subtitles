1
00:00:00,088 --> 00:00:03,980
This is where we left off in the
previous video, we have nicely organized

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,099
our worksheet and we are

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:09,019
calculating the profit, the potential
profit that we could make

4
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:12,820
by selling all of our shares. But of course,
now that we

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,000
have added this Trend column, we want to
do something with it.

6
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,007
We don't want to sell all our
shares

7
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:23,907
if the price is going up, so we want to
make a calculation -

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,088
based on a trend, we will make a decision
are we selling

9
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:31,208
or are we not selling. So how does this
look like?

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,139
We will add another column 
in this worksheet,

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:40,019
now we're going to call it the Number or the
Amount that we're going to sell,

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,160
based on the trends. So let's add another
column "Amount to sell"

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,900
and then here we will use

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,009
a conditional formula, the IF formula, and
that works as following:

15
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,749
the first part of the IF formula says what
are we going to look at,

16
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:59,960
so we say: if the Trend, the G column,

17
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:04,674
is equal to "Up", in that case, 
after the comma, we say

18
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,909
what we are doing. Well, if the trend is
going up,

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,940
we're not selling anything, we're selling
0 shares.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,520
In the other case, if the trend is going
down,

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,320
let's say we sell half of our shares. We
still remain with half of it, but we want to

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,560
sell half just to be safe,

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,720
if things are going wrong. And you see
now, in the first line,

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,860
we're not selling anything and in
subsequent lines,

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,400
in case the shares are going down, yes, 
we are selling some,

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,080
half of the shares that we have.

27
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,160
And what I can do now here to round,

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,540
as we've done in the previous video, is I
could set it to 0 decimals,

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,620
because I don't want, of course, to sell
half of share, that's not possible.

30
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,039
But what I could also do here instead is 
use the ROUND function, it has the same

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,120
function and works the same. Some people
prefer to use ROUND function because

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,259
it is more clear

33
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:03,439
what exactly is going on. You can see in
the formula

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,032
that something is being rounded,

35
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:09,065
and still our data is connected to the
web feed,

36
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:13,625
so if we hit Refresh and if something
would have changed in the meantime,

37
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:18,034
everything in the worksheet changes - so
the data, and the formulas, and then

38
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:22,514
also, ultimately, the decision of how much
shares we are going to sell.

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,560
Maybe you notice now that's
something is wrong in this worksheet.

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,900
Maybe you are

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,755
yelling at your computer screen: "Wait, wait,
I found a mistake!"

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,220
Do you know what?

43
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,000
This profit column is
now based

44
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,079
on the number of shares that I

45
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:46,037
have all of them. But, if I'm not selling
all of them, of course I'm

46
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:49,049
also not going to make profit out of all
of them.

47
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,091
So what I need to do is update my
formula not to be calculated based

48
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:58,351
on the shares I have, but on the shares
that I'm going to sell

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,000
based on the trends. And what happens now
here

50
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:06,021
is that this profit is depending on the
column left

51
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:10,007
and right to it, and that's not something
we like - if we talk about

52
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:14,700
organizing your worksheet, we want the
data to flow nicely through your spreadsheet

53
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,820
from left to right. So I swapped those
two columns and now the flow is nicely

54
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,800
logical

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,920
as you would read it normally, from left
to right. So that's also

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,600
an organization factor that you can take
into account when

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,020
you're designing your own spreadsheets.

58
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,000
So there's one more thing that we want
to do - what we want to do is calculate

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,460
the health of the portfolio that we have.
So I want to know

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,120
do I have a lot of Up shares and a lot
of Down shares,

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,760
because if a big part of my portfolio is
going down,

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,000
maybe I want to make some other decisions -
I want to buy additional shares

63
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:00,702
that are going up. So what I could do
potentially is:

64
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,509
I could use another conditional
formula as you see here.

65
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,000
I could say: if the shares are going up
then

66
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:11,920
I want to have the number of shares, and
otherwise I have 0. And then, in one

67
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,700
column,

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,020
I get a list of all the shares

69
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:20,004
that are going up. And I could do the
exact same thing for down,

70
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,760
same function: if the shares are going
down,

71
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:27,025
if the trend is equal to "Down", then

72
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:30,074
I pick the number of shares, and
otherwise I pick 0.

73
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,820
And then have two columns in which one
is all the Up shares

74
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,480
and the other is all the Down shares. And
then, of course, I guess you understand

75
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,260
this,

76
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,340
at the end of the worksheet I can add
a SUM

77
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,860
function and then I get an overview of
the health of my portfolio,

78
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,000
what part of it is going up and
what part of it

79
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:53,440
is going down. Let's see how it looks
like - I'm going to sum

80
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,200
the entire column, there we go.

81
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:03,061
So 1800 shares going up, and if I drag
it, about 700 shares going down.

82
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:07,841
So, our portfolio looks pretty okay because
a lot more shares are going up than

83
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:12,720
that are going down. However, this
calculation is wrong - you need

84
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,680
two additional columns and two additional

85
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,060
SUM formulas just to get an idea of

86
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:23,001
how things are going. This can be done

87
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:27,057
in an easier way and let me show you how.
So let's zoom out a little bit,

88
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:32,917
then you see all the extra information,
all the extra space that we need,

89
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,040
two extra columns just to calculate these
three

90
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:40,063
values, that are Up and Down. So let's not 
do it,

91
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:45,543
let's clear this room, we're going to do
it away with it, we don't need it anymore.

92
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:48,960
Right click, "Clear Contents", there we go,

93
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,680
we don't need it anymore. Let me show you
a better

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,717
and a way more compact way to actually
analyse

95
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,000
the health of our portfolio. What we
can use

96
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:03,004
is a list of all the types, so we say
we're looking for

97
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:08,240
shares that are going up and shares that are
going down. And then we use a SUMIF

98
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,012
function. It's a combination of,

99
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:15,772
of course, the SUM and the IF. And how
this function works is that I can

100
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,880
pick part of my spreadsheet, so I click
one column

101
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,700
and I say I'm going to look at
everything that matches in that

102
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,680
column. So where am I going to look is the
first part of the function.

103
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,240
In the Trend column I'm going to look
if

104
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,940
something is going on, like with the
normal IF.

105
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,940
Well, what do I need to compare to

106
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,800
is exactly the same as in the

107
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,399
IF function - I'm comparing is the
Trend

108
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,680
equal to "Up" and I've just made a list of
this. And what am I summing -

109
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,759
the number of shares. And you see me drag
down,

110
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,889
and the exact same result is appearing,

111
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:57,980
as when we had the entire column with
the SUMs.

112
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,008
So it's a lot conciser and also it
allows us for

113
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:05,034
easily adding other types of trends - for
instance we have a "Flat" trend

114
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:08,673
where nothing is changing, we can just
add "Flat" to list

115
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,479
and drag the formula down, whereas in
the old situation

116
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,599
we needed an extra column for every new
share type. So the SUMIF

117
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,400
is a really nice combination of the
SUM and the IF

118
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,700
that takes up a lot less space and is
more flexible

119
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,099
if you want to change your worksheets.
So, this week we've looked at an example

120
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,012
of a spreadsheet

121
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:34,592
where we're calculating the value of stocks,
we've looked at functions to manipulate

122
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,459
Strings,

123
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,860
text values, we've looked at conditional
formulas, the IF

124
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,659
and the SUMIF, and piece everything
together with the data taken

125
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,075
from the web. So that's everything 
we want

126
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:49,855
to talk about this week, just one more
thing -

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,039
let me ask you once more to post your
excelfies

128
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,519
on the forum, so we have an idea of who
we're working with.

129
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,040
See you next week!
