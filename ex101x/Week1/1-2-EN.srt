1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,420
In this video I will give you little bit
more insight into the syllabus

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,151
of EX101x - what are we going to do
together.

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,840
Well, we're going to work on data analysis
- I guess you understood so much -

4
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:14,961
but I will tell you what we will do: in
the first

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,140
six weeks we will work with spreadsheets
only. I will teach you

6
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:22,313
all the things you need to know about
spreadsheets - we will address

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,470
Pivot tables, array formulas, how to
test your spreadsheet,

8
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:31,026
VLOOKUPs, all the things you need.
And some people, while I was designing

9
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:32,446
this MOOC,

10
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:37,014
asked me the following question: why
spreadsheets? Why are you going to spend

11
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,794
six weeks on spreadsheets?

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,000
Especially in the era of big data, aren't
you supposed to be teaching those people

13
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,561
Hadoop clusters or 'R'? Well, no!

14
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:51,660
Spreadsheets are really relevant!
One of the reasons that is very important

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,340
to teach people about spreadsheets

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,760
is that they're very commonly used:
95 percent

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,000
of all US companies still use
spreadsheets for financial reporting.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,420
So if you're still doing it, you don't
have to feel bad because

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,000
so is everyone else. Working with
spreadsheets is

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,008
super common - 64 percent of

21
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:15,011
workers use spreadsheets in their daily
life. This is a survey

22
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:18,043
from the US Labor Statistics

23
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:22,043
from 2003, so it's a little bit old but
it's still

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,890
a lot of people. And a more recent survey,
from 2009,

25
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:29,431
showed that spreadsheets are the fourth
most common task

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,640
that people do at their job on the
computer,

27
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:36,351
after using Internet and Word
Processing, so

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,320
it's really, really common. 

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,451
And what
happens often is that spreadsheets are 

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,620
designed as a one-time solution -

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,680
you think I'm only going to use this
spreadsheet

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,660
for this one report. You just download
the data,

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,000
make a graph and this is where it will
end. And often it doesn't!

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,067
You know, you have that guy at the next
desk, and he says "Oh, that's a nice report,

35
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:03,078
can I have it as well?" Sure, you are
good colleague,

36
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,978
so you email this spreadsheet to him, 
and he changes some data,

37
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,420
and he adds a few worksheets, and the
spreadsheet starts leading its own life.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,000
And our research has shown that this is
very common - on

39
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:18,006
average spreadsheets stay alive for five
years,

40
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:22,005
and during their life span they are used by
12 different people.

41
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:25,051
So this is why it's really important to
be able to design

42
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,991
a good, error-free spreadsheet,
because even though you think

43
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:32,029
it's just for you, chances are very big

44
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,640
that this spreadsheet has a very long
life-span.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,140
So, that's the answer to the question

46
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,480
why we're doing this course in spreadsheets.
