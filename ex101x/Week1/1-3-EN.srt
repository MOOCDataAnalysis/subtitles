1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:03,891
So in this MOOC, in all of the weeks'
videos we will use

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,880
one running example for all of the
videos

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,380
that you'll also work on in the exercises.
And for this week

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:14,780
we are going to think about the
spreadsheet to handle

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,300
the Stock exchange. I don't make a lot
of money as a professor, so

6
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:23,001
I have to do a little bit of investing
on the side to make ends meet.

7
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:27,144
So I have this little spreadsheet where I have
a bunch of companies that I own some

8
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:28,279
shares from,

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,819
and the number of shares that I own. And of
course, now I want to know

10
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,029
how is my stock portfolio doing - am I
making money on it? 

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,160
So what I need for this, of course, is

12
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:44,460
recent stock information. I need to know
what the value of all the stocks is that

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,540
I have. So what I can do for that -

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,420
let me make a new worksheet and go to
the DATA tab,

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,440
and there's a button right there, maybe
you've never seen it or used it, it's

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,020
called "Get External Data".

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,019
And with this button I can get data
into my spreadsheet

18
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:03,037
from virtually everywhere. Let me 
show you

19
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:07,033
how that works. So you click the button
and you select

20
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:11,453
"From Web". And what happens is that Excel
opens this little browser, just a normal

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,000
internet browser,

22
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:17,930
and I can go to any website I want. So,
here I go to Yahoo Finance for the

23
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,040
AEX, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, and
what you see there

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:25,038
is that there are little arrows in the
browser

25
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:29,958
that I can use to select what data I
want to have in my spreadsheet.

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,060
So you just click

27
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,017
the arrow and then you click OK, and what
you get,

28
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:38,017
where do you want your data, well just in A1,
and there

29
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,617
is the data - right from the web into your
spreadsheet.

30
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,939
Isn't that cool? And this data is not a 
copy-paste,

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,460
is not a static copy, because if you hit
"Refresh" you'll actually get a new

32
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:54,541
version of the website in your
spreadsheet. No coding required,

33
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,940
just getting the data in. So this is
nice,

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,520
what I can do now is calculate how much
money I can make on the shares that I

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,660
have in my portfolio, so let's continue.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,000
I have the value right there, you see, this is
what my

37
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:14,045
stocks are worth. However, I can't really

38
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:19,042
calculate with them yet. Let me first get
the number of shares I have in.

39
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:22,088
So what I'll do now, I'll just copy it
from the other worksheet,

40
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:27,032
in next videos we'll definitely work on
how to connect worksheets in a better way,

41
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:30,992
but for now I'm just copying them. And
what I would like to do is - I want to

42
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:33,820
multiply the number of shares that I
have

43
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,020
with their value. But I can't do it, because

44
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,623
the Last Trade value that I get from the
web

45
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:43,700
is just the text, it's a "String" as we
call it,

46
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,000
and I cannot multiply it, because not
just the value is in there, but also

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,500
the time of the Last Trade.
So I need to manipulate 

48
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,480
my data

49
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,860
into being able to be calculated with. 

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
So let me add another column

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,020
where I will try to obtain the real
value - just the first part

52
00:03:07,024 --> 00:03:10,544
of the String and not the entire thing
that I cannot do anything with.

53
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:13,780
Well, what Excel has is a function called
LEFT

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,000
and that allows you for any text value
to take

55
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,580
a number of characters from the left. So,
what I can do now is - here I want

56
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,180
for this value just the first 4 characters.

57
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,035
and then I get my value. However, I guess
you maybe

58
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:32,975
predicted this, for the second line this
doesn't work,

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,340
because there are 5 characters and
not 4.

60
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,480
So, I need a little bit trickery and I
can use the FIND function for that.

61
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,300
What the FIND function does is: in a
given text

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,239
it looks for specific value and it gives
you the location

63
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,199
of that String. So you see here the space
is on the 5th

64
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,989
position in our String, and we can use
that in

65
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,049
our LEFT function. So now I'm not going
to take 4 or 5,

66
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,058
what I'm going to take is the location
of the space. 

67
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:07,838
And then I need to deduct 1 because I
don't want to include the space, I just

68
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,320
want the first part.

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,012
And if I drag this formula down, you 
see nicely

70
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:17,272
that I only have the value, and now I
can calculate something!

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,720
Now I can drag this cell reference

72
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,900
to the right, or I could also
just edit the text,

73
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,012
and now I have the right value for my

74
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:30,352
stock. So I know what profit I would make
if I would sell

75
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,402
all stocks I have for the current price
taken from the web.

76
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,220
So what you learn in this video is how
to use

77
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,017
String functions to prepare data
and this is something

78
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:46,357
you're going to encounter a lot in the
following weeks.

79
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,400
The data that you get from the web or
data that you download within your

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,240
company

81
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,380
often will not have the right form.
You get

82
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,520
a longer list, you get something in a
String while you wanted a text file,

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,500
so you have to do some data wrangling
before you can actually start

84
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,880
your calculation.
