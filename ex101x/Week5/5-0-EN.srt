00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,440
This week we're going to talk about
array formulas.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,560
Let's have a look at the example of this
week, where we

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,860
are looking at exam results for a teacher.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,660
We interrupt this recording for an important
message about Types

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,279
Today we're going to talk about

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,400
type theory, because it's super important
in order for us to be able to understand

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,250
this week's material.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,290
So, we're going to start really really
basic, so don't worry.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,060
This is easy, right?

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:39,030
2 plus 3 is 5, but these are
not just numbers. They also have the type

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,970
of being a number and I'm going to

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:45,720
annotate all types with a different
colour. So what we're calculating here

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,190
is a number and a number

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:55,920
result in a number. But this is not how
we write formulas in Excel, we can write

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,620
numbers

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,980
in a formula, but we can also use
cells. So let's have a look

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,500
at how that looks.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,100
So we have these two cells in a
spreadsheet and we can say A1

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:16,170
plus A2 in this case is also 5. 

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,320
So what are the types
here?

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,490
Well, 5 is a number, that's easy. But
A1 is not a number,

22
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,930
it's a cell, it's a reference to a number.

23
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,730
So let's draw it like this

24
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,050
and say: something that contains a number and

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,050
something that contains a number - we
can add the numbers,

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,870
and then we can get a number. There are
different types in Excel as well,

27
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,050
it's not just numbers.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,660
Suppose we have
this in the cell,

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,170
a string, a piece of text. We can
calculate on text

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,210
as well.

31
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,280
So what are the types here?

32
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,310
We have again something that contains

33
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,010
a text and the result of the function

34
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,310
is a text. So these functions all

35
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,150
take in the same values, a number
resulting in a number

36
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,480
or text resulting in a text.

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,090
But there are also functions that can
take in a certain type,

38
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,410
but return a different type. Let's have a
look at how that looks like.

39
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,500
For instance if we are calculating with dates...

40
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,040
We have a date in our spreadsheet now, and
we can calculate with dates as well.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,720
We've seen that in the past.

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,170
We could, for instance, calculate

43
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,760
the month of A1, which would result in
1.

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,370
So here you see an example of something
that takes in

45
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,730
a certain value, it takes in a container,

46
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,840
something that contains a cell, containing
a date,

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,190
but it results in a number. So there

48
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,920
you take in a date, but you return a
number. So, sometimes, the types of

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,040
input are different from the types of
the output. They don't necessarily have

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,220
to match.

51
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,840
So now let's have a look at

52
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:29,760
the most complicated construction that we're
going to look at

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,819
in this week's videos. It's still
pretty basic I hope.

54
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,580
Suppose we have a range: we have 1,

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,410
2, 3 in a spreadsheet. We can
calculate on that, we know how to do that.

56
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,400
So we can say something like the SUM
of

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,010
A1 to A3,

58
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,160
which is in this case 6. So what are the
types here?

59
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,739
Let's start with 6, because that's
super easy, 6 is a number,

60
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,470
we know that. But what do we have here?
We could say

61
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,350
we have three

62
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,440
number containers, three values that have
a number.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,080
But of course, it doesn't necessarily
have to be three.

64
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,239
We can also say: now we're summing
until

65
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:23,759
A5. Would that give the function a
different type? It would have to add

66
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,359
another container here and one here.

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
So we're not going to do that, this is
not the way that we are going to write

68
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,069
this down.

69
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:35,469
What we are saying here is: we're summing
over a list

70
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:39,219
of numbers, so the type, as I will write
that down

71
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:43,139
in subsequent videos, is a list of
numbers

72
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,120
and the result of the function is
a number.

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,789
And this is very important to remember
for the remainder of this week's videos.

74
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:53,329
That was the end of the typing
sequence.
