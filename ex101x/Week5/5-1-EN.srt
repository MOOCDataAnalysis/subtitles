00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,820
Hi! Welcome to this week's video. Today

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,389
we're going to talk about array formulas.
And we have a brand new

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:11,460
example to work with array formulas. In
this week's example

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,549
we are a teacher. And that's a nice
coincidence, because, of course,

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,980
I'm a teacher and this is actually quite a
real-life experience

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,539
of how I analyze exam results. So let's
have a look at the spreadsheet that

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,699
we're going to work with

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,490
in this week's videos. It is about a
bunch of students

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,980
that are in my class. I have their
student numbers, their names

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,090
and the year in which they have started.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,010
The names, then the IDs, and the year that
they

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,270
started their studies.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,230
And in addition to that, I have exam
results, so you see I have a number of

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,060
questions,

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,570
I have a list of students and then, for
all of the questions, I have

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,330
the perfect score and the score for all
of the students. And you might think that

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,700
I would use this

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,829
spreadsheet just to analyze the
marks for the students,

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,260
but that's not true. I also use the exam
results as a means

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,630
to analyze the quality of the exam. So
I have a look at the results

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,689
and I look at what question actually
impacts

22
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,560
the scores of the exams most. Let me
give you an example of that.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,650
So if I look at this spreadsheet, I see
that those questions 1 and 2,

24
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,259
the answers are pretty similar. In many
cases the same score is given

25
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,670
or a very similar score. So if I want to
dig into that, what I could do, of

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,040
course, is take the SUM

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,329
of all the scores for one question and
take the SUM

28
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,299
for all the scores of the other question
and compare those two together. And I can

29
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:35,829
see

30
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,990
that indeed the difference isn't that big
between question 1 and 2.

31
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,119
However, that is a bit
misleading,

32
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,350
because you see in this, if I would just
sum these cells,

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,290
the sums would be the same, yet the
answers would be very different.

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,909
So, the SUM is not a good solution to
really understand

35
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,840
how these two questions differ from each
other. So, what to do?

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,890
What I actually wanted to do, is take
the difference between

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,219
all of the cells between all of the
results for those two questions.

38
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:10,679
Let me do that, and unfortunately, double
clicking now doesn't work,

39
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,270
because there's an empty column, so I have
to really drag

40
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,930
the formula down and then I can see
the differences between all the cells.

41
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,989
But as you can see, some differences are
positive and others are negative,

42
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,260
so we need to take the absolute value of the
difference

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,599
in order to get the real difference
between

44
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,470
the two questions. So we drag

45
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,540
the absolute difference down and now we
can see:

46
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,250
Hey, is there really a difference? If we
sum these values together,

47
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,879
we see that the difference is, indeed,
between those two questions,

48
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,170
not that big. The difference is 21

49
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,500
and we have 14 students so that's
about 1.5 points

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,680
per student difference between those
questions. This helps me,

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,269
this help me with the analysis because
now I know how these two questions

52
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,239
relate to each other. However, I don't
have two questions, I have 12.

53
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,170
So if I would want to repeat this
analysis for all of them,

54
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,080
I would have to make a lot of auxilliary columns,
here you see it,

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,560
there's no end to it almost. That's not
what I want.

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,300
I hope you remember from previous
lessons that duplication

57
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,730
is not a good thing. If you're doing the
same thing over and over, if you're

58
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,760
making a lot of columns

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,390
or a lot of rows that are very similar, you
have to think of me. Please, think of me and

60
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,980
think:

61
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,950
"Oh no, duplication! No good, I have to go
back to the MOOC

62
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,500
and look at a smarter way to do this." So,

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,620
how to this smarter? Let me first remove
all those duplicate columns,

64
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,239
we don't want them, we zoom out a little
bit

65
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,069
and we also remove this, because we're
going to do this in a more compact,

66
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,269
in a smarter way. So what we would like
to do

67
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,049
is, at once subtract

68
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,709
question 1 from question 2
without all those

69
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:02,519
intermediate cells. So this is a good
attempt, we just subtract

70
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,620
a range from another range. And let's see
with the evaluate function

71
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,799
what exactly happened here now. We have
the first column, if we evaluate it

72
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,939
we get 8, which is the first item

73
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,609
of the column. And this is because what
Excel now calculates is the intersection,

74
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,180
we talked about that in previous
lessons.

75
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,380
So this is close to what we want, but not
exactly what we want. We don't want Excel

76
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,940
to calculate the intersection
immediately,

77
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,440
what we would want to have is all of the
differences.

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,310
And this is, you can guess this probably,

79
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,220
where array formulas come in, because
Excel can evaluate this function

80
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,770
in two different ways. Let me show you
how

81
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,860
the alternatives look like. So this is
sort of the normal

82
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,530
value, the normal way of doing it is what
we just did.

83
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,770
We paste this formula in

84
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,360
and now the alternative way, the array way
of

85
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,259
doing it,

86
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,550
we don't hit Enter, we hit Control+Shift+Enter.

87
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,600
And if we do, that we get this nice curly
braces

88
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
around for the formula, and this is

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,979
not good in a sense, because we get the
same

90
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,430
result. So you might think there's no
difference, the curly braces

91
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,440
don't do anything. However, the way it's
calculated,

92
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,900
is really really different.
What's underneath

93
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,389
is different. And in order for us to
understand the difference between those two

94
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:33,169
ways of calculation, we need to use type
theory.

95
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,300
In the first version, in the normal
version,

96
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,580
of the minus function, this is what
happens: We have the range

97
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,770
B3 to B16

98
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,240
and we subtract from that the
range

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,700
C3 to C16.

100
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,850
So what happens here is the reduction,

101
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,780
the intersection between the two ranges.
This is what Excel

102
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,169
returns for a range, so this is

103
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,370
8, the first intersection

104
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,390
minus 10, the second intersection,

105
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,280
which results

106
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:22,680
in -2, that's what we have seen. So what
happens

107
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,919
in the alternative version, the curly
braces, the

108
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,859
array version?

109
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,259
It looks

110
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:40,579
exactly the same, but what happens
inside is really really different.

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,580
So in this version, again

112
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,900
B3 to B16 minus

113
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,680
C3 to C16.

114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,100
In the array version,

115
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,139
no reduction takes place. Excel
calculates this subtraction

116
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,289
on the entire range. So internally

117
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:09,470
we have B3 minus C3

118
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,259
and then B4

119
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,720
minus C4 and then B5

120
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,420
minus C5

121
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,700
and I guess you can come up with the
rest.

122
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,400
And then all of this, the subtractions

123
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,889
are calculated, all of them. So we get the
list,

124
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,580
with, 8 minus 10, 0 minus 0,

125
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,780
5 minus 5, etc.

126
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,680
So the result

127
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,979
of this array, of this curly braces version

128
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,079
of the formula is a list:

129
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,000
2, 0, 0 etc.

130
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,979
But because there's no room for Excel to
plot this entire list,

131
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,800
we only have one cell, we only get the
first

132
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,610
number in the list.

133
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,479
But that doesn't mean that the result is
a number,

134
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,870
the result is actually a list. It looks
the same,

135
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,740
but internally it's really really
different. So let's go back

136
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,780
and see how this looks in Excell. We
don't need the glasses anymore.

137
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,280
So if we look

138
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,680
in our spreadsheet, we see no difference.

139
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,409
However, internally it's really really
different. The first version

140
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,509
results in a number and the second
version results in a list.

141
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,449
So what can we do with the list? It is really
nice that we have a list now, but what to do?

142
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,330
How to show and work with this list? So the
first thing we can do with an array

143
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,149
formula,

144
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,600
is give it space. Make room in the
spreadsheet for Excel

145
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,950
not to plot the first number only, but to
plot the entire resulting array.

146
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,970
So let's have a look at how that looks
like. So we're going to remove the normal

147
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,760
version

148
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,019
and the array version, so you can really
see the difference.

149
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,000
We throw them away. In the normal version

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,019
if we make room for the entire array

151
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,380
we put in a normal formula, nothing happens.
We only get

152
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,519
one result. But for the array version, if
we make room, if we give it space

153
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,490
and then we hit Shift+Control+Enter,
what happens is we get

154
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,589
the entire resulting array. And now you
see the list that we had on the

155
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:32,750
blackboard.

156
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,060
We have it now in a spreadsheet, because
we gave Excel room

157
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,320
to show: Hey, I have this entire array of data

158
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,000
to give you and not just the first version. An alternative,

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,720
what we can do with an array formula, is
flatten the list,

160
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,900
make this entire list into one value

161
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,519
by adding a function around it. So we
have a list

162
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,870
and what we can tell Excel is: do
something with that list.

163
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,310
For instance, SUM the list. So,

164
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,700
in a normal version if we would
SUM the intersection of two

165
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,959
ranges,

166
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,140
we just get -2, because the result is
-2. We can add a SUM around it, but it

167
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,769
will still be -2.

168
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:20,010
In the array version we get a different
result. Look at how that looks like.

169
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,610
If we enter the SUM around the array

170
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,130
version of the formula, then we get -5.

171
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,990
Because what happens now is the SUM

172
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,940
has been calculated over this

173
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,810
entire list that has resulted from the
array formula.

174
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,450
And here you see the comparison with all
the separate subtractions

175
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,860
and if we add a SUM around that, we get
the exact same value.

176
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,740
So this, all the separate subtraction and
a SUM,

177
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,170
results in the exact same thing as an
array formula with a SUM around it.

178
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,450
And in this way, this is how we can solve
our original problem

179
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,709
of wanting to compare all the questions
with each other.

180
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,180
We don't need an auxiliary column and
a SUM,

181
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,700
we can calculate the entire sum in one
cell,

182
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,660
and this saves us a lot of space. Let's
see how that looks like.

183
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,480
We don't need that anymore,

184
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,570
and we can use it now to calculate the
difference between question 1

185
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,769
and question 2, in one cell only. So
we take the SUM

186
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:26,149
of the entire range, the entire B-range

187
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:29,720
minus the entire C-range, where we need
the absolute

188
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,370
as we did in the beginning, and then
Control+Shift+Enter

189
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,839
gives us the result of 21, just as we had
in the beginning.

190
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,760
So with the use of array formulas, we
have reduced

191
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,529
a column and a SUM to one cell only.

192
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:46,469
That's the power of array formulas.
