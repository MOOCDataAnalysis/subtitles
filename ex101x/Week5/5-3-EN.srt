1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,520
In a previous video we looked at array
formulas.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,330
More specifically, we've looked at how to
transpose our data

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,700
so that we can filter it for questions
that we don't want to have in an exam anymore.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,809
Our data is prepared now, it's in the
right way,

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,820
so let's filter it. We can go to the filter
button, select our data

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,010
and say: Hey we don't want all of the data,
we don't want all of the questions,

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,410
we only want to have everything

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,160
beside the second row. But, unfortunately,

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,930
we still have the same result, because we
have transposed

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,250
everything including the last column

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,440
which is now the last row. So, "don't worry"
you think,

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,070
we can just delete it. That doesn't work,

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,969
you cannot change part of an array formula.

14
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,789
It's impossible once you have selected
an area

15
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,840
that's meant for an array, you cannot
delete cells in it.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,590
And this is a good, because you don't
want to accidentally overwrite part of

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,359
your array

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,510
by hitting the keyboard with your elbow.
But in this case,

19
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,030
we don't want to have the final column
anymore, we want to add new calculations.

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,880
So what we need to do is use the same

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,580
region again, but we with one row less, and
put

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,060
the array formula in again. So,

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,810
the only way we can delete the values is:
delete everything,

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,439
delete the entire array formula and then
paste it again

25
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,630
using one row less. It's a bit cumbersome.

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,650
So if you want to change an array, you have
to change everything,

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,590
but there we have it. So now we can add the
SUM function ourself,

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,390
based on the transposed data. We just
add a SUM

29
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,509
of the entire column. There we go, no
worries.

30
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,040
And we drag it.

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,220
Yep, there it is.

32
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,500
So now we can filter, we are entirely
prepared, we go to filter, we remove

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,140
the second question from the list of
questions,

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,920
and it works.

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,240
Apparently, it doesn't.

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,420
The calculation, even though the row is
filtered out,

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,580
is still calculating on the entire
column. So we cannot use a function to

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,680
filter, because it will still

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,840
calculate the entire column, unfortunately.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,730
I hope you're screaming right now, I
really hope

41
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,700
that on the other side of the video you
are saying this:

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,739
Hey, but I know why this isn't working,
because formulas are

43
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,709
not for analysis. Formulas are for
calculation,

44
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,160
if you want to do analysis you
should do something else.

45
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,390
For instance, a pivot table,

46
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,239
indeed. Okay, okay, okay, I hear you.

47
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,640
Let's try to do our analysis with a pivot
table. We get rid of the formulas

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,959
they are not for analysis. We get rid of
the filter and we select all of the data

49
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:53,730
and put it

50
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,430
into a pivot table. Filter

51
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,379
can go, we select all of the data.

52
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,650
Oh yeah, I've changed the student numbers
into 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of

53
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,050
the very long student numbers, because
that will make the pivot table a bit too big.

54
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:16,050
Let's go, we add pivot table. Yep, there we
go.

55
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:20,569
Select the pivot table and we put
it on a new worksheet that I have just

56
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,209
made.

57
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,599
Select the data and we have a pivot table.

58
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,959
So now we can filter, right? We can say: we
want all of the students, these are student

59
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,200
numbers now,

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,370
all the sums of all the students.
Click, click, click.

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,440
Yep, and we can add a filter

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,209
on what questions to use, super easy if
you've seen the week

63
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,720
about the pivot tables, you know how to do
this. We can just select

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,610
what questions we want. However, as you
see, it's pretty hard to compare the

65
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,549
different scenarios with each other.

66
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,470
Now this is 55, if I change a value

67
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,659
it changes, but what I would like to have
is have the

68
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,049
scenarios side by side. One row for

69
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,439
the exam with question 2 included and
one row

70
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,239
for the exam without question 2, without
everything

71
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,299
swapping all the time. If I do that,

72
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,130
the only way I could do that is to make
two pivot tables with two different

73
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,250
filters.

74
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,150
And then of course we're running into
the duplication problem again.

75
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,080
There's another downside of using
pivot table for this analysis.

76
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,120
If we go to the table field settings down
here,

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,560
there's a limited number of functions we
can use.

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,870
So there is SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, but not

79
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,250
all of Excel's I think 350+
built-in functions are there.

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,240
There's a limited set a functions that we
can use. So if we're summing the exam

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,729
results, that's fine,

82
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,979
but if we want take differeent quartals for
instance,

83
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:51,320
if we want to use the MEDIAN

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,460
or we want to use the MOD, then
there's no way that we can do that with

85
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,090
a pivot table.

86
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,449
So in conclusion, yes, formulas are for
calculation and not for analysis,

87
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:05,780
however, there are some limitations to
what you can do

88
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,880
with pivot tables, because they don't
support everything and also they don't

89
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,889
really support

90
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,789
scenario analysis in which I want to
compare two different filters with each

91
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:15,530
other.

92
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,280
And that's where you're going to need
array formulas.
