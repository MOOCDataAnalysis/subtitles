1
00:00:00,929 --> 00:00:04,830
Array formulas. We've looked at how to
analyze

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,750
the data for the quality of the
exams. So we're not necessarily looking at the

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,240
quality of students, we're looking at
what questions in our exam

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,710
contribute towards the end marks. And I
think we can

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,200
say that we've come to a conclusion that
question 2 doesn't really help,

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,760
it's not different from question 1. So,
of course, we can just

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,900
clear content, throw everything away. But

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,890
that's not what I want. I manually inputted
everything, so I want to keep

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,850
the values,

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,590
but still I want to have the ability to
analyze.

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,100
So, I could filter, but

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,820
the way the filtering works in Excel, is
you can only filter in this direction,

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,440
you can only filter on rows, and you
can't filter on columns.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,340
And that's exactly what I want, because I
want to filter out one question and I

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,560
don't want to filter out

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,940
one student. So what I need to do

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,780
is change my data, transpose my data
into being in a different direction.

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,400
So how to do that? What I can do is: I
made another worksheet,

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,130
called ExamTransposed, where I want to transpose
my data.

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,810
Excel has a function for that, I can just
say:

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,430
TRANSPOSE, type it in the formula bar.
There we go,

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,189
TRANSPOSE, and I select the array of data

23
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:23,389
that I want you to transpose and then I
hit Control+Shift+Enter.

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,840
So what I get now is just

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,509
one cell, because, as we've seen in a
previous video, I haven't given Excel

26
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,490
the room, the space

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,740
to plot the entire array. So if I want to
have

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,909
everything transposed, I need to make
sure there's enough room in my worksheet

29
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,850
to plot everything. So how much room do we
need?

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,189
Well, we have 16 rows so that will be 16
columns,

31
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:52,700
and we have 14 columns currently, so there
will be 14

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,840
rows. So if we go back to our transpose
worksheet, we make sure that we make enough

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,119
room for everything, and then we can use the
TRANSPOSE function with Control+Shift+Enter,

34
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,869
making it into an array formula, and now we
get the result of the entire array.

35
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,389
So what was previously one row is now in
a transposed version

36
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,739
one column.

37
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,120
So why am I showing you this?

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,150
Well, first of all, we want to have the
results in a different direction,

39
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,750
but I also want to point out an
important difference in Excel functions.

40
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,859
Some functions are array functions

41
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:31,239
for instance, TRANSPOSE. If you enter it
you already see, as an argument

42
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,620
you need to put in an array, so the
TRANSPOSE is

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,579
an array function in a sense. It always
operates on an array,

44
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:42,150
there's no other way. You can't put in a
number, it doesn't know how to transpose

45
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,790
a number.

46
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,779
However, other functions, like the
subtract function,

47
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:50,079
that we've seen in a previous video, they
not are

48
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:54,540
inherently array formulas, but you can
make them into array formulas

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,629
by giving them a range as an argument
and then

50
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,839
they can be made to work on all the
pairs. So some functions

51
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,599
are array and others can be made array

52
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,819
and that's also what the exercises of
this video will be about.
