# Subtitles
All subtitles for the EX101x MOOC can be found here.

## Adding a translation to this repository
If you are interested in adding a translation to this repository, please follow
the steps below. If you are interested in proposing a fix to existing subtitles,
please check the section on [fixes](./uploadInstructions/submittingFixes.md).

To add a new translation to this repository, two situations are possible. Either
we have already created branches for you to fill with the subtitles, or no such
branches exist yet. If you are unsure whether we have created them, you can
check by clicking on the dropdown menu that says "branch: master". You will get
options like this:

If there is a branch called "WeekXYY" where X is the week number and YY is the
abbreviation of the language you want to add (e.g. NL for Dutch) then a branch
already exists and you can [add your work
there](./uploadInstructions/existingBranch.md) If no such branch exists, you
will have to [create one yourself](./uploadInstructions/newBranch.md). If you
are not a part of our organisation you will have to [create a
fork](./uploadInstructions/fork.md) before following the instructions above in
your own clone of this repository.
