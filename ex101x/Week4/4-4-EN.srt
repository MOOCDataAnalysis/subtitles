1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,260
In the previous video, we've turned our
data into a data table

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:09,240
and done some analysis on top of that. So
what we want to do now is

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,320
actually make our planning. We want to
make a schedule for what teacher teaches

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,120
what course on what day of the week.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,750
So ultimately, we're going to want
something like this,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,320
but let's start with an intermediary
step first.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,470
We have here a list of what courses are
taught on

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,900
what day of the week. So we want to have
in our planning,

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,030
initially we don't have the names yet, we
just want to have Xs

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,219
on the spots where we have a course and
empty spots or dashes

11
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,949
on the place where we do not have a
course for a given level.

12
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:44,699
So we can do that with a function that
we have already seen in the past,

13
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:48,659
namely the FIND function. There we go.

14
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,420
We can use the FIND function to search
for

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,829
a value in a string as we've seen before.
So we're going to find

16
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,530
this 1 in the list of all the courses
that we have on Monday.

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,750
And we have found it, if we execute this
formula,

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,540
you see that indeed there is a 1 in this
string

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,150
on the first spot, so on 1. And here we
have to add a dollar of course, because if

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,610
we're going drag the function down

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,810
then we want to stay focused, stay
pointing on the first line.

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,660
And what you see now is that in case we
do not find the 1, we get

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,950
an error value. We can catch that error value
with a function

24
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,240
called ISERROR, so we can ask Excel is

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,780
this formula resulting in an error,
yes or no?

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,630
Or I should say true or false, because
that will be the result of the formula.

27
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,570
You see in the case where we have found
1 we get a FALSE.

28
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,990
Now we can slap and IF on top of that, we
can say

29
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,770
if we get an error, well, then we want to have
a dash, and if we do not get an error then

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,030
we want to have an X.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,250
So that we get Xs in all the spots
where we indeed have the given course

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,880
on the given day.

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,310
So almost there, we can drag this
formula to the right

34
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,510
and then we have

35
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,810
our formula. Unfortunately, we have
forgotten something,

36
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,790
again another dollar. They are so
annoying and so easy to forget, right?

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,849
So if we add a dollar to our formula, it
will work, we can drag it to the right

38
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,989
and indeed we have got our function.

39
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,249
But, I do not particularly like this formula
a lot...

40
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,870
If you look at it,

41
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,900
you have the one dollar here and
the other dollar there,

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,510
I'm pretty sure that if you look at this
formula tomorrow or maybe in a week or

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,159
three, you look at this like: "I don't really
remember what is going on here".

44
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,099
So we can make this formula a lot easier,

45
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,730
by using... I guess you can guess this...

46
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,230
A named range. So if we take this

47
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,329
first row of the spreadsheet and

48
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,230
change that into a named range, let's call
this

49
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,560
'HorzLevels', Horizontal Levels. Then there's
a

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,879
special trick that we can use,

51
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,399
if we use a named range like this. What we
can do is what we can refer to that named range

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,560
from a lower row. Let's have a look at how
that looks like.

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,469
If we just enter into this cell: is

54
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:21,590
equal to the named range, what we
actually get

55
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,810
is the intersection of the column that
this cell is in

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,180
and the row that represents the named range.

57
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,349
So without doing anything, no cell
references or no calculation, we're just

58
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,919
pointing at a named range, we get the value

59
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,959
at the intersection. We can copy this
down, no ugly dollars needed,

60
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,299
and you'll see that you get the value
from the named range. And if you go

61
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:45,709
outside of it

62
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,939
then you get an error. We can use this
little trick

63
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:55,760
to beautify the formula that we just had,
let's have a look at how it looks like.

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,639
So here again, in slow-motion

65
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,359
I will show you what we've done, because
this might take you a while, for your brain

66
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,219
to really understand how the intersection
works. So if you refer

67
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:11,349
from a cell to a given named range what
you will get

68
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,540
as a result is the intersection of the
column you are in

69
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,670
and the named range. So we can use
that in

70
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,530
this function, lets see how that goes. So
we can get rid of that

71
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,360
ugly little dollar, let's remove it right
away. And we can

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,230
replace it by a reference to the named range.

73
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,280
It's a lot easier to read, you don't need
to

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,100
think about the dollars, you don't need to
think

75
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,350
about copying,

76
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,480
you could just say I'm pointing up to

77
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,320
the 'Horizontal Levels' named range. And
this trick does not

78
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,570
only work within one worksheet, it also
works

79
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,510
between worksheets. So if we go back to
this

80
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,280
'Lessonsl worksheet and call this column
'Levels',

81
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,880
we can also use it from this worksheet.
So if we refer now

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,010
back to the worksheet, no formula is needed,
no functions needed, just

83
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,980
a reference. You see that in the same
fashion you get the intersection

84
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,010
of the named range in the one worksheet
and the row you are in currently.

85
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,790
So we can use that as well here, we are
going to say I want to find

86
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,590
the horizontal level in the levels. So your
formula

87
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,750
is a lot more readable, you can just
navigate

88
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,750
the named ranges that are in the
worksheet if you have forgotten where

89
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,500
they are,

90
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,250
by using the drag down and selecting a
named range within the formula.

91
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,210
So from ugly dollars to readable

92
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,990
functions with named ranges.
