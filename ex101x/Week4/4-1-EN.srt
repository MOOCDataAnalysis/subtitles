00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,860
Hi, welcome back! For this week's exercises

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,970
we use as running example a "Dance studio".
So we have a number of teachers

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,059
in our Dance studio with names, ages, the
tariff,

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:16,820
what they cost if we hire them, the
maximum level that they can teach

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,300
and the preferred level, the level that they
like to teach most. For instance, Georgie

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:21,720
here,

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,240
even though he can teach up to level 5,
he prefers to teach at level 1.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,100
So, of course, on this data we have

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,160
we want to do some sort of analysis. So
let's start

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,620
by analysing for all of the levels we
have how many teachers do we have that

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,850
teach that level. So we make a list of
all the levels

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,450
in our dance school - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - and

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,800
the 'Number of Teachers'. And for this we
can use the COUNTIF

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,690
function, which is very similar to the
SUMIF function

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,250
that we have seen in previous videos. So
we're going to count

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,250
for a given range, in the 'Teachers'
worksheet,

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,699
how many teachers are there for a given
level.

18
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:06,079
So we can just click the 'Level'. And what
this actually means,

19
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,899
even though it's not really clear, is we
are calculating the number of teachers

20
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:14,359
that is exactly equal to this level

21
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:17,469
in the first column. And that's actually not
what we want,

22
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,420
because we want to calculate who is able
to teach level 1,

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,469
so someone who's able to teach level 3
is, of course,

24
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:29,520
also able to teach level 1. So what we want,

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,950
instead of this equality in the COUNTIF,
is we would like to have

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,079
a comparison - we want to compare the
level

27
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,310
to the level in the 'Teachers' worksheet.
And we can try this,

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,479
but this unfortunately, even though it looks
really nice,

29
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,869
is not allowed Excel syntax. We have
to make a little text out of this,

30
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:51,729
a string, by adding quotes and ampersand
sign (&).

31
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,479
And now in B we get the comparison what

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,789
number of teachers we have that can
teach up to

33
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,409
a certain level, so everyone that can teach
level 1 or higher.

34
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,219
And you see that this is actually what
we want,

35
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:08,890
although there's one little mistake - in
that final column here, we have

36
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,319
4 and 5, we expect to get 4.

37
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,650
However, we get 3. And I guess you've seen
my mistake because I forgot

38
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,840
to insert the dollar signs ($) when I dragged
everything down.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,700
So if I want to have it correctly,
I should not forget

40
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,760
to use those dollars. And what's also a little
bit cumbersome here

41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,150
is if I would accidentally use another
column, let's say

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,609
I make a mistake and I type 'E',
it's very hard to see that I've made a

43
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:39,379
mistake because 'D' and 'E'

44
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,969
contain very similar values, it's hard to
see for me

45
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:47,579
where this formula points to. So these two
problems,

46
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,180
you shouldn't forget the
dollars

47
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,019
and it's hard to see where a cell
reference is pointing at, are nicely

48
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:54,819
addressed

49
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,030
by using Named Ranges, and that's a topic
of this week.

50
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,109
So let's go back to our example and see
what we can do

51
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:06,060
if you want to change that reference
into a named range.

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,810
We go to the 'Teachers' worksheet and we just
select a bunch of cells

53
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,349
and type the name that we'd like to give
to that

54
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,859
range of cells. Super easy, you just go in
the upper-left corner

55
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:22,859
and type the name. And if you've forgotten
where are certain named ranges located, you

56
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,629
can use this little drop-down box

57
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:28,090
and it automatically points to the
named range.

58
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,090
And you can use this named range now in a
function

59
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,560
instead of the cell references. So I
can select

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,599
the named range, even get a list
here of all the named ranges I have in my

61
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,549
spreadsheet,

62
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,700
and I just drag it down. And now it's
really easy to see

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,299
what I'm calculating.

64
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,859
It's easier because I can just read it, like
a book or like a sentence.

65
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:52,959
I'm counting the maximum level of the
teachers.

66
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,709
I don't have to figure out where exactly
I'm referencing to,

67
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,689
and that's the power of named ranges.
