00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,130
So in this week's videos I've taught you
about Named Ranges.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,549
But, of course, we're still running our
Dance studio and the

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:12,130
ultimate goal of this week's exercises is
to actually complete a planning

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,660
for our Dance studio. So let's have a
look at what we've done so far:

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,730
we have improved our formula with
use of named range, we've made a data table

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,050
out of the teachers, we have all the
information. There's one thing

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,800
that we still need and that's the
availability - what

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,670
teacher can teach on what days of the
week, because not all of them are

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,340
available

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,730
all the time. But we have an issue now
here, because in this worksheet

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,050
the days of the week are in this

12
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,420
direction, whereas the availability
is in the other direction.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,810
Well, we can fix that by selecting this
data and copying it with Paste Special

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,829
in a transposed way, so all of the data
is flipped.

15
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,380
And now we can copy it back to the original
position. But what has happened now

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,760
is our worksheet has changed, but
the named

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,380
ranges have not. So the name is still
'Horizontal levels',

18
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,500
but in the spreadsheet it doesn't mean
Levels anymore,

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,000
it's actually days of the week now. And
this is one of the risks,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,060
unfortunately, of using named range that
I would like to call

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,680
the Basmati Effect. Often in your
spreadsheet, but also in normal

22
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,830
programming,

23
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,250
it happens that your code changes, your
spreadsheet changes,

24
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,140
but the values and names you have
given to them

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,010
have not changed, and then you get things
like this where you have a container

26
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:38,440
saying

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,850
"Rice" but actually it contains cookies. And
this is what happens in spreadsheets as

28
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,170
well, and this is what has happened now in
our example,

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,189
where we have a name called 'Horizontal
Levels', but it actually contains

30
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,920
days of the week. So your exercise for
this week, the first

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,920
exercise, is to fix this. I would like
you to use the Name Manager to change

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,720
this name into

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,979
appropriate name,

34
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,119
but also to fix the formulas in such a
way that you are again

35
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,509
retrieving data, so that you get Xs

36
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,549
on the spots of the days and the levels.
And the second assignment

37
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:18,919
is to actually make the planning - so not
just the crosses, but

38
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,430
actual names for teachers that can teach

39
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,919
at a given day for a given level. So that's
your assignment, use named ranges but

40
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,370
also

41
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,940
all of the things we talked about in
previous videos to complete this planning.

42
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,200
Good luck!
