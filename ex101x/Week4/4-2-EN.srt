00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,240
In the previous video we've introduced a Named Range - for a certain column in our spreadsheet.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,920
But, of course, as you remember from one of
the previous videos,

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,420
spreadsheets have a very long life-span,
they can live up to five

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:20,109
years. So at one point, in our little dance
studio we are going to hire a new teacher

5
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:23,539
and if we do that, if we would just
enter this new teacher

6
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,019
into our 'Teachers' worksheet, let's say
his name is Harry and he is 25,

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,150
we enter all his data. Unfortunately,

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,769
if we then go to our 'Planning' worksheet,
the formulas

9
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,979
will not have been updated. We are still
calculating

10
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:42,519
based on the old named range, you see
there is no change

11
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:46,149
in the values here. And it is
understandable - if you go back to

12
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,249
the 'Teachers' worksheet and select the named
range,

13
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,859
from the drop-down list, you see that
the 'Maximum Level'

14
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,659
is not including the last line in
our worksheet.

15
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:01,309
So if you want to update a given named
range, you can use the Name Manager as

16
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,600
you see here, so the names are not fixed,

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,009
you can always update them if your
spreadsheet is changing.

18
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:09,630
And now you see, if you select 'Max. Level'
again,

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,880
all of the rows are included in the

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,659
named range and also our formulas are
updated. So

21
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,130
you can update your named range every time
you

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,509
make a change to a spreadsheet.

23
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:23,289
However, this is dangerous, because I'm
sure,

24
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:26,409
at one point, you will forget about

25
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:30,369
all of the named ranges you have in your
worksheet and you'll forget to update one

26
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:32,399
of them if you enter new data.

27
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,340
So although it's possible with the named
range manager

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,729
to change your named ranges, this is not a
preferred solution - you want to have your

29
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,200
spreadsheet as automated as possible. An alternative solution

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,450
is using an entire column

31
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,630
for your named range. You can do that if
we go back to the named

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,140
range manager. You don't need to use a
fixed

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,969
column, you can say 'all the rows in my
column'.

34
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:01,850
This is allowed syntax and now you'll see
that

35
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,439
the whole column is indeed included in
the named range.

36
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,979
And if you add another teacher now,
let's say we add

37
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,599
a teacher called Shelly, the formulas will

38
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,480
be updated to include this new teacher,
because, of course, it's calculating

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,370
the entire column. So this is a good
solution,

40
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,290
however, there is also a downside to
this solution,

41
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,010
because what happens now, if you want to
do some analysis

42
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,209
on the 'Teachers' worksheet, so let's say
we want to calculate something like

43
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,870
the most common level we have in our
group of teachers.

44
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,939
So we say 'Most Common Level' and there's
a formula for this in Excel called MODE,

45
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:46,069
really nice function that you can use to
calculate the most common value

46
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:50,939
in a bunch of cells. So this works, we
know now that the most common level

47
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,629
in our group of teachers is 3.
However, because our named ranges

48
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,049
are covering the entire column

49
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:02,449
this MODE will now also be included in
our calculation and that's not what

50
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:03,379
we want.

51
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,269
So, yes, you can use an entire column,

52
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,400
however, then all these cells underneath our
little data table

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,959
are not usable anymore, they're sort of
"blocked", because we cannot put

54
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,500
calculations in them

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,439
because the other calculations will use
that data as well.

56
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,000
So, we are stuck here and in the next
video I will show you

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,340
how to solve this problem.
