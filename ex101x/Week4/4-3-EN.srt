00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,400
In the previous video I showed you how to
use

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:07,339
named ranges. They're really nice to use,
because it makes it a lot easier,

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:11,719
to read your formulas. However, there is still
an open challenge,

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,639
because we want to be able to add new
teachers to our worksheet

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,310
without having to update either the formulas
or the named range. So if we would like to

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,020
add for instance myself, I'm going to
moonlight as a dance teacher,

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,040
I want those formulas to be updated automatically

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,680
and our current solution of using an
entire column as a named range

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,920
is actually no good, because it blocks
all of the cells

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,710
underneath the data. So in this video I'm
going to show you an alternative

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,420
solution

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,149
that will address both of these problems.
We can select

13
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:46,469
our data. Let me remove myself, I will
re-add myself later.

14
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,829
Now we can select all the data
in our worksheet and we can insert

15
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,999
a data table, insert table right
there.

16
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:59,600
And then Excel asks us to select what data
we would like in the data table

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,190
and also whether or not our data has
headers, whether the first line describes

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,830
what the date means. And first of all, we get
this nice little visualization on top

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,970
of our data,

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,000
but also what is happening is that all
of these columns are

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,740
automatically turned into something
like named ranges,

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,040
labeled by the first line, labeled by the
headers,

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,490
so we can use that in our formula. We
can say: we want to count

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:30,290
'Table1' and then we get all of the columns in
our table, we want to have 'Table1' -

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,590
'Maximum Level', and now the formula works.

26
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,770
And, if we add another teacher to our roster,
let me re-add myself

27
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,600
as a dance teacher, you see a little corner
thingy over there

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,870
is going down with the table and that
shows where the table ends.

29
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,320
So as soon as you enter a new row into the
table,

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,520
the table is extended and you don't have
to update the named range. So let

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,980
me add another teacher to show you

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,220
that little table thingy, the corner edge
is showing you where the table ends.

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,530
So this is a solution that looks really
nice, we have all the benefits

34
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,879
of named ranges. However, we don't have to
change

35
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,920
anything in case we're adding teachers.

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,629
But there's one thing that's super ugly,
actually I hope you have been

37
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:22,599
shouting at your computer screens again:
"Oh no, I don't like the name of that

38
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,409
table!

39
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,040
How can you have a video about named
ranges, names

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,860
with a table that is called 'Table1'? That is
crazy!"

41
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,740
You are right, my friend, that is crazy.
Lets immediately change the name of the

42
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,620
table, because

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,060
this is super ugly. We can do that, as I
showed you in a previous video, with the

44
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,040
name manager,

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,950
but there is another solution as well,
to get rid of that

46
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,510
ugly 'Table1'. If we go back to the
'Teachers' worksheet and select the data table,

47
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,849
we get an additional tab in the ribbon.
And there,

48
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,180
we can easily change our table without
selecting anything.

49
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,579
And you see that within the formulas
now also we get

50
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,870
table 'Teachers' instead of 'Table1'. We
don't have to

51
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,069
update anything. And there's more we can
do

52
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:10,620
in this ribbon tab. For instance, we can add

53
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,810
slicers, this is really like a filter,
you see the logo is similar to a filter

54
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,529
but it's more interactive.

55
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:20,909
You can click all the tariffs you want
and the data table will

56
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,069
update automatically. So this is a nice
little way,

57
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:28,279
if you have changed your data into a
data table, to interactively play

58
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:31,290
with what is in your dataset.

59
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,739
And I encourage you, this is not really
an exercise, but I encourage you

60
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,659
to download the spreadsheet from our
course page and to play with everything

61
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:40,849
that's there.

62
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:44,959
Because the data table allows for a lot
of playing: you can change the markup,

63
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,510
you can add total columns or total rows,
so download the spreadsheet and play

64
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,419
with it, because it's

65
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,679
really really nice to work with data
tables. See you in the next video!
