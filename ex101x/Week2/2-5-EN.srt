Hi! In previous videos we look at the
use of VLOOKUP,

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:08,840
when to use it, and, specifically, when to
use the TRUE and FALSE parameters.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,320
Unfortunately, there's also trouble in
paradise -

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,048
The VLOOKUP function isn't always

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:19,328
perfect. And in this video I'm going to
show you two reasons

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,969
when you're not going to want to use
VLOOKUP.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,859
So, if we're in a little hardware shop, but we're
only selling seven different

8
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:31,017
items using VLOOKUP is definitely
fine,

9
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:35,417
there's no problem at all. But suppose
we're running a huge hardware store

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,059
with like six thousand different

11
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:41,459
items. Then, our nice little VLOOKUP
function that you see here,

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,780
if I drag it down now, will take a long
time. You see

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,060
calculating... one Mississippi... Yup, there it is.

14
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:51,069
It's pretty slow and it would be okay
if it would

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,920
only be slow if I'm calculating
the VLOOKUP function.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,035
But the spreadsheet will now remain slow

17
00:00:58,035 --> 00:01:01,071
because the VLOOKUPs will be
calculated all the time.

18
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:05,851
For instance, probably you've noticed my typo
here - I'm not selling a Clam Hammer,

19
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,036
I'm selling a Claw Hammer. So if I'm
changing that

20
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:12,856
small typo, again everything has to be
recalculated.

21
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:16,955
So, using a lot, like six thousand
VLOOKUPs in the spreadsheet

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,940
is going to make my spreadsheet slow for
every operation

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,759
that I have. So, the first reason
VLOOKUPs can be cumbersome

24
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,339
is they're pretty slow for large datasets.
The second reason,

25
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,239
suppose your boss comes into your office
and she says "Hey, I want to offer a

26
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,399
discount today on

27
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,989
Claw Hammers and Rip Saws, and you need
to give me the associated codes because

28
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,419
I need to put those codes

29
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,899
into the register system for the discounts". And
you're like:

30
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,319
Oh, I know how to do that! I've been following
this super cool

31
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,034
online Excel course, I can do it! I'll
just put in the names,

32
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:56,194
that's easy - the Claw Hammer and the
Rip Saw, I will type them up.

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,180
No problem, and I'll just use
VLOOKUP

34
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:04,002
to look up the codes that go with the name.
VLOOKUP,

35
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:07,009
I know how to do it, look up the name, 
go to the

36
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:10,607
information sheet... Oh...

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,400
What

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,560
column do I send back? -1?

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,920
I want to have a value that's back in
the stream.

40
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:21,460
Unfortunately, there's no such thing as 
a -1 column

41
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,040
in VLOOKUP. The only way you can
use VLOOKUP

42
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:29,079
is this way - from the first column, and
retrieve something that's

43
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,999
in a later column. There's no way that you
can go back

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,500
in the stream with VLOOKUP function.
It only works

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,840
one-way! So these are two reasons that
VLOOKUP functions

46
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,014
aren't perfect. If you want to have speed

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
or if you want to have a two-way street,
you want to look up

48
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:51,058
in both directions, then, unfortunately,

49
00:02:51,058 --> 00:02:55,718
VLOOKUP function is not the right
function. There's also good news -

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,908
in the next video I will show you what
functions to use

51
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:03,824
as an alternative, if you're in one of
those two scenarios. See you there!
