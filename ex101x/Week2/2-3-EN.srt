00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:05,437
Hi, welcome back! In the previous video we
looked at how to use the VLOOKUP,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,013
but we didn't yet look at the fourth
parameter, as I promised to you.

3
00:00:09,013 --> 00:00:12,562
So in this case we only use three
parameters -

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,319
what to look, where to find it
and what to return.

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:20,025
But, there is still room for a fourth parameter, 
and maybe,

6
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:24,785
if you did the exercises in between, you
saw that if you add an additional comma

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,500
then Excel is going to make suggestions
for that fourth parameter.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,060
Let's have a look at how that looks like.
You click,

9
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:36,980
you add a comma, and then Excel says "Hey, I have these two choices for you".

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,760
Either you use TRUE, which is an 
approximate match.

11
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,739
It's going to give you more or less what
you're searching for.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,720
Or, alternatively, we can use FALSE
which is going to give you

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,159
an exact match, exactly what you're
looking for. I would say this is only

14
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,939
a little bit helpful, so let's try to
see the difference

15
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,619
in our example worksheet by putting
FALSE into

16
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:04,079
one of the columns. Let's say we put
FALSE into the selling price

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,880
and we are going to put TRUE into
the lookup

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,040
of the name. Now we have, side by side,
the TRUE and the FALSE version of the

19
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:12,820
VLOOKUP,

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,280
and that will allow us nicely to see
what are the exact

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,920
differences between the different
versions of the fourth parameter.

22
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:25,174
So imagine we're in this scenario: one of
your colleagues comes into your office

23
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,228
and he says "Hey, I noticed you've been
doing this cool analysis of what turnover we

24
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:30,520
make for what product,

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,522
but I would like to know what turnover
do we make for

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,189
my favourite product, X098.

27
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:41,034
Can you calculate that with your
spreadsheet?" Of course!

28
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:45,085
You can do that with your spreadsheet! 
So again, we have TRUE in one

29
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:48,805
column and FALSE in the other, and now we're
going to input

30
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,049
X098, take the formulas that we have,

31
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,909
and drag them down. Now you can see what the
difference is, because in column C in the

32
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,079
Selling Price

33
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,043
we have #N/A, "not found".

34
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:05,403
Excel says "Hey, that X098, I can't find it",

35
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,027
whereas, in the B column, Excel can still
not find it,

36
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:13,020
but he says "Yes, the closest 
I could find

37
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,660
is the Fountain", because alphabetically
the H is closest to the X,

38
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,560
so it just returns whatever value
is closest.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,020
So, I guess from this you can understand
what value you usually want.

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,420
You want to use FALSE, because if you
have FALSE

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,800
then you get a warning sign if a value
that you have searched for

42
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:39,780
has not been found. So, remember this, if
you're using VLOOKUP,

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,020
to couple two worksheets together, 
you're usually

44
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,000
going to want to use FALSE. This is like
the basic setting

45
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:50,036
because if you use FALSE you get a
warning if

46
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,816
your result isn't found. Unfortunately,

47
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:57,027
FALSE is not the default setting. If I
remove

48
00:02:57,045 --> 00:03:01,059
the parameter and restore my formulas
as they originally were,

49
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:05,079
you see that the behaviour of the formulas
is like when I input

50
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,006
TRUE - it always tries to find an
approximate match.

51
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:12,008
This is a bit unfortunate, but yeah, this
is the decision that was made by

52
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:16,031
the Excel team. Probably they didn't really
guess that

53
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,371
that connecting a worksheets was
going to be the way

54
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,000
that people use VLOOKUP mostly.
So we have to remember ourselves

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,660
to put in FALSE as the

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,079
preferred setting, it is, unfortunately,
not the default.

57
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,031
Don't forget it, because forgetting to
add FALSE is one of the reasons of

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,920
many many spreadsheet errors.
