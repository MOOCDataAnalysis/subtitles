00:00:01,016 --> 00:00:04,856
Hi, welcome back! In the previous video I
explained you

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,000
that usually, if you want to use the 
VLOOKUP function,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,520
you're going to want to use FALSE as the
last parameter,

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,760
because you want to be warned if a
certain value

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,940
isn't found when integrating two
worksheets. However, there are scenarios,

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,980
though, where TRUE

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,380
is the good choice, and in this video I
will explain you when

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,900
you have to use TRUE. So, for instance,
when we're doing this analysis:

9
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:32,002
in this new worksheet I've created, we're
going to have a detailed look

10
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:35,008
into the use of margins. So, for instance, you had
to

11
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:39,037
talk with your sales director and he
said "Hey, I would like to know

12
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:44,517
for what product we have a good margin
and for what other products our margin

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,440
could be

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,039
increased maybe?". So, first of all,

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,039
for each code we're going to look up the
margin. And this is still just

16
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,050
an old fashioned VLOOKUP with
the FALSE,

17
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,729
where we're going to the ProductInfo
and we're returning the sixth column,

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,893
which is the margin. We change that.

19
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:06,014
Again, don't forget the dollar sign, it's
really important that you remember that!

20
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:09,674
And then you drag the formula down and
you have all the margins.

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,320
Now we want to do the analysis on top of it.
So we want to know

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,900
is this a good margin or a bad margin.
We can input

23
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:20,606
a formula for that, a simple
conditional formula that we talked about in

24
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:21,740
previous videos.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,760
We just say: if our margin is, let's say,

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,960
smaller than 20 percent then it's bad. In
the alternative case, if it's bigger than

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,080
20 percent, but still smaller than 30,

28
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:37,986
we're going to say the margin is OK, and
in other cases, if it's above 30,

29
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:41,899
then we're going to say: yes, our margin
on this product is good!

30
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:45,006
So, yes, we can do this with a
conditional formula,

31
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:48,526
just drag the formula down,

32
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,013
and we have it! Nothing wrong with it,

33
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:56,573
well, we are nesting conditions here and
you should remember from previous videos

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,360
that if you're nesting a lot of
conditionals then a formula can get

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,610
complicated.

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,020
You might not expect it, but this is
actually a very good scenario

37
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:09,257
to use a VLOOKUP! It is really different
from

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,078
looking up values over two tables, but
actually

39
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:16,998
the VLOOKUP applies here, and let me show you how! 
What we can do here

40
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:21,524
is add a table in our worksheet where
we add the classification.

41
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,960
So we say: for margin of everything above

42
00:02:25,048 --> 00:02:29,328
zero the classification is going to be
bad,

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,200
everything between 0 and 20

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,900
is going to be OK, and everything above
20, between 20 and 30,

45
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:41,335
is going to be good. The exact same
classification as we just put into

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,900
the conditional formula. Now we can

47
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:48,822
get rid of the whole IF, the nested IF
that we didn't really like,

48
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:52,019
and put a VLOOKUP there. We're going
to look for

49
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,068
the value of the margin in this new

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,680
margin table, we're returning the second
column

51
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,041
and then we're going to add TRUE, because
we don't want to look for 22,

52
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,072
you know that 22 is not in the table. We
want to look

53
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:10,072
for the closest margin that there is,  
to 22.

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,420
And you see that the functionality in
this VLOOKUP

55
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,800
is exactly the same as the functionality
of the IF.

56
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,980
And doing it this way you can see it's
very easy, because if you want to change

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,700
something in my table you just saw me
change

58
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,777
'ok' into uppercase 'OK'. I can just do
that

59
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,054
in the table, I don't need to change the
formulas, just change my table

60
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:33,894
and all the formulas are updated. 
Even more so, 

61
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:37,900
if I want to add another classification,
like 40 percent is

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,980
the best margin there is, I can just
add it to my table

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,800
update the lookup table and then my
condition is updated.

64
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,438
Whereas if I should I do that with an IF,
then I would have gone on

65
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,038
another branch of the IF and my formula
would get longer and longer and longer.

66
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:57,698
And with this VLOOKUP solution it
doesn't matter how many classifications

67
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,719
I have. If I have a hundred, this formula 
will still be one

68
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:04,649
VLOOKUP, whereas if I have a
hundred classifications

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,940
in a conditional formula, then I'll have
a hundred IF.

70
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:11,942
Or, actually, I would have ninety-nine
IFs, but that would still be a lot.

71
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,008
So, if you are classifying things, if
you are dividing a certain value

72
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:20,043
into different categories using an IF,

73
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:24,083
then I hope you remember this scenario -
you could use VLOOKUP

74
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,020
with TRUE

75
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:29,161
to substantially simplify your formulas
in such scenario.
