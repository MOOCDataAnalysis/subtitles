00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,360
Hi, welcome to this week of "Data Analysis to the 
MAX()"

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,139
In previous weeks we have looked at how
to calculate with formulas and how to

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,419
operate calculations 

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,073
based on conditions. But 
this week,

5
00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:18,613
we are going to look into lookup 
functions - how to combine data

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,380
from this part of your spreadsheet and
that part of your spreadsheet, and correctly

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:22,960
put it together.

8
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:27,023
And VLOOKUP functions are very, very 
popular - you could say they are like

9
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:28,033
Taylor Swift

10
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:31,065
of Excel formulas. Lookup functions are

11
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:35,066
in the top five of the most used 
Excel functions,

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,140
and this is why it is very important to
know how to use them

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,689
and when to use them. So, let's look at 
this week's example.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,920
Imagine you are running a hardware store. So, here you have

15
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:51,079
information that you export from your
register - you can see

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,014
what item code you have sold, when 
you've sold it and for what price.

17
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:58,073
And, on top of that register data,

18
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,041
we are going to do some analysis - we want 
to know what

19
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,068
items have we sold. So you can see here

20
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:08,728
the codes, the associated names, the price 
we sell it for,

21
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:13,139
the price we bought it for, the margin, 
which is the difference between those

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,040
two prices,

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,560
and the margin expressed in percentages.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,240
So for this data we want to do
some analysis.

25
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,339
More specifically, we want to know what 
turnover do we make

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,320
for each of the items that we sell. So we 
could do that

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,035
like this, where we have the codes and the 
names, and then

28
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:37,175
from the ProductInfo sheet we import - 
we directly link

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,500
what the selling price is. And then, with 
COUNTIF function

30
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:45,119
we can look at the actual register data, 
we can see

31
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,425
what, when, how many items have we sold

32
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,001
of this particular type, and if we 
multiply

33
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:55,310
the number of times we have sold a
certain item with

34
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,043
the price that we sell it for, then we
get the turnover per product

35
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:01,203
that we need.

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,940
There we have it. We have calculated

37
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,119
the turnover per product. So, the first 
thing that you see that's a little bit

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,640
strange about this formula

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,819
is that Excel inputs a link to

40
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,038
this worksheet into the formula. That 
happens because,

41
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:23,097
while we were building the formula, we
moved to a different worksheet

42
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:26,877
and back, but of course that's not what we 
want. So let's first

43
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:31,022
get rid of that prefix - just remove it, 
because it's not necessary,

44
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:34,382
it just makes our spreadsheet more
complex than is needed.

45
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,140
So the question is now - is our 
spreadsheet now perfect? Are we in the

46
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,013
perfect state?

47
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:44,013
Maybe you have encountered this problem
before, maybe you know

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,900
why this is a problem. If you don't, let 
me take you through what's problematic

49
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,519
about organizing your spreadsheet in this way.

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,040
To show you this, we're going to select 
all data in our worksheet,

51
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:02,959
copy-paste it into a fresh worksheet,

52
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,002
and we're going to copy-paste it as values, 
just so you can see

53
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:11,820
what the original value was, because, 
maybe, some things are going to change

54
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,209
if I mess up my spreadsheet. So, just to be
sure,

55
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,004
we make a copy of the original data. Now
let's go back

56
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:23,020
to our ProductInfo worksheet and do
something very innocent -

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,011
we're just going to sort our ProductInfo worksheet,

58
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:30,390
sorted based on the selling price. You can think:

59
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:34,000
"Well, sorting something is never going to
mess up my worksheet"

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,480
However, if you look now at the Turnover
per Product we see that our Bench

61
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,089
is suddenly worth only 10 Euros where 
previously

62
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:46,629
it was worth 250. And this is because, as 
you can see here,

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,420
the links are still pointing at the original values,

64
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,340
and even though we have sorted them, 
the links haven't changed. So we are

65
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,360
pointing directly

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,060
at the wrong value. So what you
should

67
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,749
remember from this example is that if
you make a link

68
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:05,698
over worksheet it doesn't get sorted, if
you sort

69
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,980
that worksheet with, you see in the 
result here,

70
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,000
potential for error. So this is exactly
the scenario

71
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,541
where instead of a direct link we want to use

72
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,360
a lookup function. You'll see that in the 
next video.
