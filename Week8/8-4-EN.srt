Hi welcome back to Delft University of
Technology

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,660
for the final week of Ex101x Data
analysis to the MAX(). I hope the past few

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,349
weeks have been

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,960
as cool for you as they were for us. We
had almost 30,000 people joining us from

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,470
193 countries,

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,330
it was amazing, it was so great to see
all of your Excelfies,

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,619
people were joining us for the MOOC,
right here in Delft, but also in Austria,

8
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,650
in Texas and even in Gotham City. We got
so many Excelfies,

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,850
we were even able to make a mosaic
of the course logo

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,129
consisting of Excelfies. We will put a
high-resolution

11
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:42,469
picture of this online so you can print
it out and

12
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:46,480
hang it on your wall or zoom in to see
if your Excelfie is also on there.

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,860
And even though not all homework deadlines
have passed

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,309
we have already received 122 thousand

15
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,050
quizzes and fifty thousand
assignments. It was so interesting for us

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,460
to see you working on the exercises,

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,019
asking questions on the forum and
submitting the results to us,

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,159
we can really learn a lot from them for

19
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,250
the research. And maybe before you were
doing this MOOC you thought that research

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,530
labs were like this

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,740
people mixing chemicals in the lab, but
our spreadsheet lab is actually like this.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,000
We're just working on a computer, but
we're still doing research and we are

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,240
really going to use all the answers 
that you submitted

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,780
to improve our spreadsheet analysis algorithm.
So a really big thank you for

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,960
all of you that have participated in
our labeling game.

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,659
Over 80,000 clicks were received and in
our classification game

27
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:41,810
3,000 classifications were received. So if
you wanna know what we will be doing

28
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,040
with that data,

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,820
please go to the website, we will post
the link here below the video,

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,020
you can register for the newsletter of the
spreadsheet lab and we'll keep you posted

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,600
on all the cool things that we will do with
all the data that we collected.

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,329
So that's it, EX101X comes to an end
and I really hope to see you again

33
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,040
in an another MOOC on EdX. Bye!
