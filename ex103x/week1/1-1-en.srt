00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello eh, hello Miss Kiers.
Thank you so much for taking the time...

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,440
to have a Skype meeting with me today.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,760
Yes. Who are you, please?

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,640
So, I'm Felienne.
I am an intern in your hotel.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,790
I have been working here for a few weeks,
and eh...

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,399
No one seems really to have a good idea of
what is going on in the hotel.

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,939
Like, how many night we usually sell,
how many people are there.

8
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,469
Everything is fine in the hotel.
- Yeah I know, I know, it's great.

9
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:35,620
But I just took this course on Data Analysis
and I thought maybe if we look into the data

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,060
of the hotel we can learn a bit more about
exactly is going on.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,060
Well, I'm not sure if that is necessary.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,200
But if you really want to,
I can ask Gretta to send you some files.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,500
That would be very very much
appreciated, if you could...

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,400
Thank you Felienne.

15
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,260
Thanks, bye.
