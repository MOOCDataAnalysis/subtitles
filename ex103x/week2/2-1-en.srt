Hello again Miss Kiers. Did you…
- Hello? Who are you?

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,280
I am Felienne, you know? The intern.
We Skyped last week...

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,240
and then I sent you some files, because I did look
at the data and thank you so much for sending…

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,420
Your files! I received your files.
- Oh great!

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,620
This is it, right?

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,500
Yes, that looks like...

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,820
All these data... All these numbers...
[RIPPING PRINTED FILES] I can't use this.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,860
What? Why not?
- I need visualizations!

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,780
Oh, I can get visualizations. I know how to
make nice charts and graphs, so...

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,540
next week I will send you fantastic plots, I swear.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Looking forward to your visualizations, Felienne.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,580
Okay, okay, see you next week, then.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,080
Thank you.
